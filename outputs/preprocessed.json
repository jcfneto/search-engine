In addition, the clinical and radiographical status of the lungs have been evaluated using 2 scoring systems. Precipitins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrated in all sera, the maximum number in one serum was 22. The concentrations of 12 of the serum proteins were significantly changed compared with matched control persons. Notably IgG and IgA were elevated and the \"acute phase proteins\" were changed, the latter suggesting active tissue damage. The concentrations of 3 of the acute phase proteins, notably haptoglobin, were correlated to the number of precipitins suggesting that the respiratory tract infection in patients with many precipitins is accompanied by more tissue damage than the infection in patients with few precipitins. The results indicate no protective value of the many precipitins on the tissue of the respiratory tract.", "74002": "Rossiter-M-A. Barrowman-J-A. Dand-A.

Nail clippings from 1322 newborns, 22 CF patients (two of them newborns), 52 healthy controls and 22 heterozygotes were analyzed. The discrimination between CF patients and controls was found to be precise for individuals above one year of age and INAA of nail clippings should be accepted as a diagnostic test for CF after this age. Heterozygotes could not be detected by the method. During the first five days of life there is a big overlap between the values from normal newborns and those of CF children, which makes the method invaluable for early screening for CF.", "74004": "Kollberg-H.

TIME-FACTORS.Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of nail clippings was used in the development of a diagnostic method for cystic fibrosis (CF). From CF patients and controls more than three years old, nail clippings were sampled for tests of different errors. As a result of this study a precise collection routine was outlined. Sodium is easily washed out from nail clippings. The risk of sodium contamination of the nails seems to be small. The sodium distribution in the nail is inhomogeneous, and the sodium content varies also from nail to nail in the same person. There is good evidence that the increased sodium in the nails of CF patients comes from the sweat. There seems to be a basic \"intrinsic\" sodium level, which is about the same in the nails of CF patients as in controls. The precision and accuracy of INAA for determining sodium in nails is considered satisfactory. It is concluded that INAA of the sodium concentration in nail clippings is a suitable method as an aid in the diagnosis of CF if a precise collection routine is used.", "74005": "Lindberg-T.Proteolytic activity in duodenal juice in infants, children, and adults.Acta-Paediatr-Scand. 1974 Nov. 63(6).

One group (9 patients) suffered from chronic Ps. aeruginosa infection in the respiratory tract and produced multiple Ps. aeruginosa precipitins which were demonstrated by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The other group (9 patients) had never harboured Ps. aeruginosa in the respiratory tract and presented no demonstrable precipitins against this bacteria. The lymphocytes were examined for the presence of 2 surface markers for B cells: receptor for C3 complement component (EAC rosette-formation) and surface immunoglobulins (immunofluorescent staining), and for the presence of 1 surface marker for T cells: spontaneous binding of sheep red blood cells (E rosette-formation). The B:T cell ratio was nearly identical in the 2 groups of patients whereas the total numbers of B and T cells were significant higher in patients with chronic Ps. aeruginosa infection.

The one-year period prevalence rate of patients harbouring Ps. aeruginosa was 64 per cent. In newly colonized patients and in intermittently colonized patients non-mucoid strains were predominating, whereas mucoid strains were predominating in chronically colonized patients. The occurrence of mucoid strains, especially in chronically colonized patients, was associated with a significantly higher number of precipitins against Ps. aeruginosa than the occurrence of non-mucoid strains. Males chronically colonized with mucoid strains presented a significantly higher number of precipitins than females chronically colonized with mucoid strains and the number of precipitins was correlated with the duration of the chronic colonization with Ps. aeruginosa in males in contrast to females. The results are in accordance with the hypothesis that mucoid substance could be a virulence factor because it might inhibit the opsonizing effect of the precipitins on the mucoid cells and the complement dependent lysis of the cells hereby favouring mucoid strains at the expense on non-mucoid strains in the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients.", "74008": "Hoiby-N.Epidemiological investigations of the respiratory tract bacteriology in patients with cystic fibrosis.Acta-Pathol-Microbiol-Scand [B]. 1974 Aug. 82(4).

The fluctuations of the bacteriology are described by additional epidemiological terms: At one or more examinations during the study (period prevalence rate), 90 per cent of the patients harboured St. aureus, 64 per cent Ps. aeruginosa (mainly mucoid strains), 64 per cent H. influenzae, 37 per cent D. pneumoniae, and 30 per cent miscellaneous other bacteria, mainly Enterobacteriaceae. This pattern was found in all age groups with minor age-dependent modifications, especially as regards Enterobacteriaceae. Ps. aeruginosa was predominating as regards chronic colonization which reflects the most difficult therapeutic problems, the period prevalence rate being 39 per cent in contrast to St. aureus: 10 per cent, and H. influenzae: 1 per cent. St. aureus was predominating as regards new colonization and recolonization which reflect the problems of prevention, the incidence rate of new colonization and recolonization per risk group being 84 per cent, followed by H. influenzae: 62 per cent, Ps. aeruginosa: 43 per cent, and D. pneumoniae: 30 per cent.

Rapid expansion of our knowledge of the basis of genetic disease and the development of reliable diagnostic methods have led to rapid advances in the intrauterine diagnosis of a large number of inherited disorders. Prenatal diagnosis was initially used to determine the presence of Down's syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities and for the determination of fetal sex in pregnancies at risk for a number of severe X-linked recessive disorders. Shortly thereafter, it became clear that the same techniques could be applied to the prenatal diagnosis of a number of the inborn errors of metabolism. Most recently, a number of new techniques have been developed that may prove to be of great value in the prenatal diagnosis of a number of severe congenital malformations that before now could not be diagnosed prior to birth. The goal of this review is to define the past achievements, future goals, and present limitations of intrauterine diagnosis. The first section will deal with the general approaches used in prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders. This will be followed by a discussion of the specific applications of the basic techniques to the intrauterine diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and of the inborn errors of metabolism. Approaches to prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders include amniocentesis, direct and indirect visualization of the fetus, analysis of maternal blood and urine, and sampling of fetal tissues. Applications of prenatal genetic diagnosis include X-linked recessive disorders, chromosomal abnormalities, inborn errors of metabolism, disorders of lipid metabolism, disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, disorders of mucopolysaccharide metabolism, disorders of amino acid metabolism, and miscellaneous disorders such as cystic fibrosis. These techniques provide some parents with methods for having children without fear of having a child with a specific deformity. In addition to the development of approaches which will increase the number of disorders detectable in utero, the potential for treatment of genetic disorders is unlimited.", "74015": "Dooley-R-R.

RABBITS.As far as rabbit alveolar macrophages are concerned, the concentration of homozygous CF serum used in our experiments was even greater than the fourfold concentration which Biggar and associates state was required for normal phagocytosis. Increasing dilutions of homozygous CF sera with either Hanks balanced salt solution or normal human serum, thus decreasing its concentration, increased the capacity of the rabbit alveolar macrophages to phagocytize and kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing concentrations had just the opposite effect. Suspension of rabbit alveolar macrophages in human serum reduced their phagocytic activity, but activity was reduced more by human CF serum than by human normal serum. This is not unexpected because high human serum concentrations are likely to be toxic to rabbit alveolar macrophages. Because the inhibition of phagocytosis was absent when homozygous CF serum more than 24 hours old or previously heated or frozen was used and because of our observations that dilution increased macrophage phagocytic ability, we feel our data demonstrate the presence of a labile inhibitor rather than a deficiency. Since it is well known that CF patients have normal or elevated concentrations of immunoglobulins including IgA in their sera and pulmonary secretions and respond to infection, and IgA has not been shown to be essential for alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we cannot agree that this inhibition is due to an IgA deficiency. We also note that some of the sera used in the experiments of Biggar and associates were stored at -70 degrees C. Perhaps this may account for the difference in results.", "74019": "Coburn-M-D.

A decrease in mean SRaw from 4.2 sec cm H2O for females 5 to 9 years of age to 3.5 sec cm H2O for those over 18 years of age paralleled sexual maturation, but similar changes were not observed in the males. A direct correlation of SRaw with clinical observations was found in young patients with various degrees of pulmonary involvement because of cystic fibrosis.", "74023": "Boat-T-F. Kleinerman-J-I.

Explanted epithelium retained its morphologic characteristics and incorporated 35SO4 and 3H into blood group specific glycoproteins that were secreted into the medium throughout the culture period. Labeled mucous glycoprotein was solubilized by reduction and alkylation, then purified by gel filtration chromatography. Purified glycoprotein was further separated on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose columns into 3 blood group active fractions. These fractions had similar amino acid compositions but differed in N-acetyl neuraminic acid and fucose content and in relative incorporation of 35SO4 and 3H-glucosamine. Blood group glycoproteins from polyp epithelium of patients with allergic rhinitis and cystic fibrosis were indistinguishable in many respects. However, the 35SO4 per 3H ratio of all 3 glycoprotein fractions from patients with cystic fibrosis exceeded that of the corresponding fractions from secretions of patients with allergic rhinitis.", "74024": "Mansell-A.

Isovolume flow-pressure relationships were measured in 7 of these patients, and a modification of the flow-volume test was evaluated for detection of flow reduction in a separate group of 63 patients. Relative to results in a control group of 31 normal subjects, 13 of the 24 patients had grossly abnormal pressure-volume curves with excessive stiffness of the lung near maximum volume and loss of recoil at lower volume. Closing volumes in these patients were often high enough to cause significant disturbances in gas exchange and the elevated closing volumes were quantitatively explained by the low values for elastic recoil. The modified flow-volume test detected mild flow reduction in many patients who otherwise had normal pulmonary function tests. Loss of recoil per se did not account for the low maximum expiratory flows, since \"upstream\" resistances were high. However, pressure-flow curves were effort-dependent at high lung volumes even in patients with severe airway obstruction, showing that time constants of emptying varied widely in these patients. It was concluded that deterioration of lung function in cystic fibrosis involves more than airway obstruction and that the worsening gas trapping is explained by a progressive loss of lung elastic recoil.", "74025": "Gibson-L-E.Use of water vapor in the treatment of lower respiratory disease.Am-Rev-Respir-Dis. 1974 Dec. 110(6 Pt 2).

The following 2 nights patients were randomly allocated to a tent supplied by either a jet or ultrasonic nebulizer. The early morning sputum was analysed for volume, viscosity, water content, and DNA content, an index of purulence. There was no relation between sputum viscosity and DNA content, water content, or volume. Furthermore, there was no consistent relation between sputum viscosity or volume expectorated and the presence or absence of an 8-hour stay in the tent with either method of water nebulization. These results therefore suggest that mist therapy does not consistently influence sputum viscosity or volume in patients with CF.

The usual presentation is with bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass normal meconium. 4 cases had distended abdomens at birth. Plain abdominal x-rays are of great diagnostic value. Pneumoperitoneum is diagnostic but absent from early films. Treatment is surgical.

The method was simple and reliable provided that the operator had had reasonable experience with the instrument. One distinct advantage of the method compared with the use of filter paper was the speed with which results were obtained. The design of the instrument made the method completely safe and only a few patients noticed slight tingling during iontophoresis.

The social and emotional problems experienced by family members, particularly the patients and mothers, are reported on. At all ages, socially embarrassing symptoms and awareness of being different create major problems for the patient. The uncertainty of prognosis and doubts about the prospects of employment are specially relevant for the teenager. It is suggested that the patient be given ample opportunity, from early adolescence onward, to discuss all aspects of his disease, and that more appropriate provision should be made for the total care of adult patients. Many problems, such as depression, feelings of isolation and the physical demands of constant treatment, which the parents of children with cystic fibrosis experience, are probably similar to those confronting parents of other chronically ill and handicapped children. But special difficulties stem from the genetic basis of cystic fibrosis and from the knowledge of an eventually fatal outcome. The roles of professional members of the medical team are touched on, particularly in relation to genetic counseling and the provision of practical and emotional support to parents.

The main disability is usually diarrhoea, but there may be abnormalities from lack of absorption of an essential nutrient or occasionally from absorption of compounds in excess due to failure of a normal control mechanism. These diseases are experiments of nature which cannot be exactly simulated in the laboratory animal, and thus may on occasions give information unobtainable from other sources. Most often, however, they confirm that the mechanisms of absorption studied in detail in smaller mammals are probably applicable to man. In some of these diseases there is an associated defect of transport in the proximal renal tubules as well as in the gut. They furnish evidence, therefore, that transport processes are closely related in the gut and in the kidney, or at least that an important step in transport is identical at the two sites. Such disorders include disorders of carbohydrate absorption, hereditary defects of amino acid absorption, hereditary defects in the absorption of fat, hereditary disorders of the intestinal absorption of electrolytes, and hereditary defects of vitamin B12 absorption.", "74047": "Mitchell-Heggs-P.

Elasticity of sputum has been determined using the Weissenberg rheogoniometer, by oscillatory testing, over frequencies from 0.01 to 0.8 c/s. Sputum was from patients with either asthma, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, or bronchiectasis and, macroscopically, mucoid, mucopurulent or purulent. As in the viscosity plot over this shear rate range two Zones with a junctional region can be distinguished. In Zone 1, over the lowest shear rates, elasticity increases slowly, changes little over a \"plateau\" region and then, in Zone 2, increases sharply. In contrast to the viscosity plot, the plateau does not show nothing. By 0.8 c/s some samples show decreasing elasticity. Although variance between samples is wide, there is no level of elasticity characteristic of each disease or of one macroscopic appearance. Elasticity and viscosity are correlated, most significantly at the lowest shear rates.

They were shown to depend markedly on the clinical state of the children particularly on the presence of pulmonary tract infectious processes. These infections caused a rise in immunoglobulin concentration with predominance of IgM in C.F. children aged up to 3 yrs, and with predominance of IgG in older children. Mean titer of isohemagglutinins in children with C.F. was higher than in healthy children. Low titers of diphtherial and stapholococcal antibodies were found. In the case of anti diphtheria antibodies, this can be attributed to the fact that these children are not regularly vaccinated owing to their poor clinical condition. As to the low titer of antistaphylococcal antibodies this is a well known finding in the course of chronic staphylococcal infections of appropriate bacteriological tests in our C.F. children. Furthermore their lymphocytes showed an increased blastic transformation when stimulated with staphylococcal filtrate.

Ten per cent of the CF patients had elevated or reduced serum IgG concentrations and there seems to be a transient low serum IgA concentration in the same number. Serum IgM concentrations were normal in CF patients. Normal levels of the three serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA and IgM) were detected in the siblings and heterozygotes. Serum IgE concentrations were elevated in 32% of patients with CF but normal concentrations were detected in heterozygotes and siblings. Precipitating antibodies to various antigens and allergens were detected in the sputum of most patients with CF, but their sera contained lower or undetectable titres of these antibodies. The precipitating antibodies in CF sputum to bacteria, to agar, to seminal fluid, to urine and to human serum may be related to a common antigenic determinant of the glycoproteins present in all these fluids. The total protein concentration in the sputum of CF patients seemed to reflect the extent of lung damage. The third component (C3) of serum complement concentration was normal, or moderately elevated in all CF patients tested. Serum transferrin concentrations were normal in CF patients but their prealbumin levels were depressed, suggesting marginal undernutrition.

A variety of conditions must be considered when studying the wheezing child.

Rather, it is the secondary signs and symptoms that lead the physician to suspect this entity in children. The most common of these are chronic nasal discharge and chronic nasal obstruction. A careful nasal examination is essential for the recognition of chronic sinusitis, the most common predecessor of chronic sinusitis. Allergic rhinitis is probably the second most common background of acute and then chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis in children with cystic fibrosis is a characteristic finding. Sinusitis is common in cleft lip and cleft palate children.

The changes in total serum protein and in all protein fractions were significantly correlated with clinical and radiological severity of the lung disease. All terminal patients had severe changes.

SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-NON-P-H-S.Since 1900 improvements in general hygiene, and the development of antibiotic therapy have enabled many of the epidemic infectious diseases, particularly those of infancy and early childhood, increasingly to be controlled. In contrast, the morbidity and mortality of diseases of genetic origin have been little affected. The rational use of cell culture as an investigative technique in inherited metabolic disease is rooted in the simple biologic truth that, since a full complement of chromosomes is present in all somatic cells, it should be possible to detect the specific biochemical consequences of gene activity in cultured fibroblasts unless, during the process of differentiation, genes are irreversibly inactivated. The usefulness of tissue culture in investigating inherited metabolic disease does not rest with the biochemical identification of the primary defect. The cells in culture provide a model system of the disease, which can be used to test the possible effectiveness of therapeutic agents. Tissue culture techniques indicated that the cells derived from patients with cystic fibrosis showed metachromasia.

Its occurrence in children of Afro-Americans is quite rare and exceedingly so in those of Oriental extraction. Since cystic fibrosis is genetically determined as an autosomal recessive trait, and since the obligate heterozygote parent is entirely asymptomatic, the disease on its first occurrence in a given family can only be suspected by its manifestations in the patient himself. At present there is no test available for the detection of cystic fibrosis which can be applied as a simple, practical screening test, such as is available for phenylketonuria.

Anisylalanine was slowly metabolised mainly to acetyl anisylalanine, and p-methoxyphenyl-pyruvic acid and lactic acids which were excreted. In normal adult subjects anisylalanine (25 mg/kg body weight) was rapidly absorbed, maximum plasma concentrations being obtained 0.5-1.0 hour after ingestion.

PREGNANCY.Cord serum, amniotic fluid and meconium of a newborn from a heterozygote (PiZZ) mother were investigated. In the newborn infant the diagnosis of homozygote (PiZZ) deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin could be established in cord serum at the time of delivery. Trypsin inhibitory capacity (TIC) and alpha1-antitrypsin (AT) in cord serum were in the range of adult homozygotes. By means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis exclusively, the phenotypic alleles ZZ were demonstrable. This excludes the possibility of materno-fetal transfer of alpha1-antitrypsin. In infant amniotic fluid extremely low antiprotease-activity and substantially no alpha1-antitrypsin was found, whereas in normal samples the TIC is 3% to 6% of the cord serum values and the AT 1.2% to 4% of cord serum concentration. Our data suggest that a major component of TIC and AT in normal amniotic fluid derive from the fetus. In normal meconium we detected TIC and AT in concentrations increasing proportionally to the total protein content. The inhibitory capacity of AT in meconium expressed in mg trypsin inhibited per mg alpha1-antitrypsin however is 80% less than serum alpha1-antitrypsin. No correlation exists with the free tryptic activity of meconium. The AT of an PiZZ infant is clearly diminished when referred to fresh weight, whereas meconia from three cystic fibrosis newborns screened by the BM test had extremely high concentrations. Estimation of TIC and AT in meconium is regarded as a useful approach for screening on homozygote alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. The exact diagnosis however can only be established by phenotyping the alleles. In cystic fibrosis the high protein content of meconium is accompanied by increased alpha1-antitrypsin levels.", "74073": "Danes-B-S.Advances in the diagnosis of human genetic disorders. pp. 297-317.In: Kelly S, et al., ed.

Admissions to hospital in 1972 for coeliac disease in the Republic of Ireland - which does not yet have full returns of hospital admissions - was approximately three times greater than the number expected based upon the rates in England and Wales in 1969-71. In Scotland the admission rates for coeliac disease were about twice the expected number based upon the English rates. This contrasted with admissions for cystic fibrosis which were only slightly higher in Ireland and in Scotland than in England and Wales - evidence that the high admission rates for coeliac disease represent a genuinely high rate in the community. Admission rates for coeliac disease were as high in the East and South of Ireland as in the West. In Ireland, the potato, and not the wheaten bread, was the staple diet before the great famine of the 1840s. In nineteenth-century Scotland, too, less wheaten bread was eaten than in England and Wales.

It was also hoped that such standardization would facilitate the more accurate study of all aspects of study of minor salivary gland secretion collected in this fashion. From the findings, it is obvious that less minor salivary gland secretion was collected from cystic fibrosis patients than from normal control subjects, using a capillary tube test. This may be due, in part, to an increased viscosity of minor-salivary-gland saliva in cystic fibrosis. Unfortunately, viscosity studies were beyond the scope of this investigation. The results indicate that the relative differences between the volume of minor salivary secretion collected at a standard test site and that collected over the total lower labial mucosa are similar. The volumetric differences in minor salivary secretion have again been found to be distinctive enough to suggest that studies be continued in this area to further refine a diagnostic test procedure for cystic fibrosis of the pancreas. At the present time, studies are in progress to measure the volume of minor salivary secretion at a standard test site employing an electronic technique.

The results confirm the value of the Toluidine Blue O metachromasia phenomenon in white cell cultures as a method for heterozygote detection in cystic fibrosis and suggest that it may be justified to replace the tedious, expensive and time-consuming fibroblast technique with the much simpler and more rapid leukocyte culture procedure. The simplicity and apparent reliability of the leukocyte culture procedure as outlined here should facilitate intrafamilial investigation and co-ordination of metachromasia class with other parameters such as sweat electrolytes, ciliary dyskinetic factor and clinical manifestations.

This strain has previously been shown to lose resistance to several antibodies (Lacey et al., 1973); during the last 6 months further changes have occurred in it in vivo. Lincomycin resistance appeared after the patient had been treated with clindamycin. This was due to mutation to constitutive resistance to both lincomycin and erythromycin at a locus adjacent to that determining \"inducible\" resistance to erythromycin. Both loci are probably carried by an extrachromosomal element. Three types of variation in the PF plasmid were observed. Alteration in production of penicillinase from macroconstitutive to microconstitutive, was not associated with any detectable change in plasmid size. This change gave the cell an advantage in vitro, because it was associated with a faster growth rate and probably also in vivo, because the microconstitutive variants were isolated in increasing numbers after flucloxacillin therapy had ceased. Complete loss of determinants for penicillinase production and for resistance to cadmium ions from the PF plasmid was associated with a decrease in plasmid size of about 4 x 10 6 daltons. This change was also associated with increased growth rate in vitro.

Four groups of presenting signs and symptoms were right lower quadrant mass, chronic abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, and hepatomegaly. In all cases the symptoms precipitating operation were due to the underlying unrecognized condition: cystic fibrosis. Review of the histology of the appendix revealed the classic changes of hypersecretion of the mucous glands to be present. The appendix shares in the generalized intestinal mucous gland involvement peculiar to cystic fibrosis. Awareness of this fact has not been widespread, perhaps because of the usual emphasis on the pulmonary and pancreatic aspects of the disease. Greater appreciation of the clinical symptoms of cystic fibrosis and more liberal use of the sweat test could have diminished the number of exploratory celiotomies. Recognition of the histoloc changes in the removed appendices can also suggest the proper diagnosis and lead to earlier institution of treatment with an improved prognosis.", "74097": "Dolan-T-F-Jr. Touloukian-R-J.Familial meconium ileus not associated with cystic fibrosis.J-Pediatr-Surg. 1974 Dec. 9(6).

We have also participated in the care of identical male twins with this interesting symptom complex. These twins offer two more examples of the edema-anemia-hypoproteinemia symptom complex of infant cystic fibrosis. In the presence of transsupplementation and the absence of hemolysis, the normal serum iron and increased peripheral and marrow iron values suggest that the anemia results from a defect at the level of hemoglobin synthesis, and that iron transport remains sufficient in the face of protein depletion. Possibly, a relative iron deficiency occurs after increased nutritional intake due to increased utilization. Lee suggested that the hypoproteinemia is due to loss of protein in stools, but these twins suggest that the problem lies not with losses through urine or stool, but rather with failure in protein synthesis. The possibility of hypoproteinemia secondary to liver dysfunction is attractive. Although all liver function tests and biopsy findings were normal, this is often the case in patients with cystic fibrosis. The anemia is associated with increased serum and marrow iron values, and is most likely due to a decrease in hemoglobin synthesis.

It seems that parents are well aware of this response, and repeating Professor Elliott's observation by soaking the hands of six infants with cystic fibrosis in hot water showed that very marked wrinkling was present by five minutes and often by two minutes. This did not occur in control children of similar nutritional state except in a case of twins - one with cystic fibrosis, one without - where the unaffected child's fingers began to wrinkle slightly by five minutes.

POLYMORPHISM-GENETICS.An unsolved problem in human population genetics is the high frequency of the gene for cystic fibrosis (C.F.) in Caucasians. Whereas the gene frequency is probably low enough in non-Caucasians to be maintained by recurring mutation, this is not the case in Caucasians, where the carrier frequency is approximately 1 in 25. In order to establish a stable genetic polymorphism for a gene where the homozygous state is lethal, some degree of heterozygote advantage must exist, and it has been suggested that C.F. heterozygotes have a higher reproductive fitness than normal individuals. It is not possible, of course, to know exactly how stable the C.F. polymorphism is, and one cannot exclude the possibility that some form of heterozygote advantage has existed at some time in the past and no longer exists today. We should like to suggest a possible explanation which has much in common with the generally accepted explanation for the very high frequency of the sickle-cell gene in certain populations. In the latter case, heterozygotes have an increased resistance to a particular type of malaria. Patients with C.F. and heterozygous carriers have been found to have, in their serum, a substance (probably a protein) that agglutinates Proteus vulgaris. Immunological cross-reactivity between certain strains of Proteus (e.g., OX 19) and Rickettsia prowazeki has long provided the basis of a serological test for typhus (Weil-Felix reaction). Thus it is conceivable that the C.F. heterozygote might have an increased innate ability to counter infection by R. prowazeki. Although typhus is known in many parts of the world, it seems to have been predominantly endemic and epidemic in the temperate regions inhabited by Caucasian peoples. Some areas where it is now endemic, such as South America, first experienced the disease after it had been introduced by Europeans. This would seem to be compatible with the observed higher C.F. gene frequency in Caucasians than in other groups.", "74106": "Elliott-R-B.Letter: Skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis.Lancet. 1974 Dec 7. 2(7893).

This biochemical heterogeneity is comparable to what has been reported in fibroblast cultures and serum. The amount of Na2-35SO4 incorporated into G.A.G. material found in both the incubation medium and the cells from C.F. patients is significantly increased over normals. A similar analysis between normals and heterozygotes shows no significant difference in Na2-35SO4 incorporation into G.A.G. material of the cells. However, 4 out of 6 heterozygotes appeared to show a pattern of increased incorporation into material found in the incubation medium (indicated by a higher mean than the normal donors).

In addition, the blood from 2 mothers (heterozygotes) of C.F. patients was assayed.

The female controls had slightly higher C3 levels than did the male controls, but this difference was not significant. Comparison of C3 levels from all of the C.F. subjects to the controls shows considerable overlap in values, especially in the men. These studies suggest that an assay of serum-C3 does not effectively distinguish C.F. subjects from patients with other types of chronic lung disease. However, the differences between C.F. women and C.F. men is interesting and deserves further attention.

Since the predominant flora of hospital nurseries is not now Staph. aureus but rather gram-negative bacteria, it may be that the initial exposure of C.F. patients is to an organism other than Staph. aureus.

In only 57 of these cases was there other evidence of infection; these 57 were treated with antibiotics. The remaining 53 were left untreated. Of these, 41 remained completely free of infection by standard criteria at subsequent review. In 12 cases, however, the patient developed obvious infection before the next clinic visit. It could be argued that in those cases the N.B.T. test had given early evidence of infection not otherwise apparent. This is by no means certain, since the onset of infection could have been at any time during the four-week interval. In our experience, the N.B.T. has been of little help in the management of cystic fibrosis. There were in this series 27% false-negatives and at least 37% false-positives, some of which had very high counts.

Moreover, serum-G.R. from C.F. patients and carriers responds differently from controls after storage or incubation with heparin. We have now examined G.R. in white blood-cells (W.B.C.) of C.F. patients.

No differences in G.R. activity between the groups was apparent after 4 and 6 days. White-cell G.R. activity apparently is lower in C.F. patients than in controls.

The simplest explanation is that the initial white-cell G.R. differences between C.F. patients on the one hand and controls and carriers on the other are secondary to some aspect of the disease or its treatment; but there is no evidence to support such a conclusion. These results, which reflect altered behaviour of G.R. from C.F. patients, suggest to us that G.R. is involved in C.F.", "74120": "Moynahan-E-J.Letter: Skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis.Lancet. 1974 Oct 12. 2(7885).

Instead, methods of screening more limited populations at risk for particular disorders within a nationally coordinated administrative structure should be established.

This hypothesis was recently confirmed by Robertson et al. Using 35S-heparin they demonstrated an increased uptake of heparin in short-term C.F. white-blood-cell cultures which corresponded to the observations made on the basis of staining. However, as mentioned in 1971 by Bafalluy et al., any white blood-cell in culture can be overloaded with heparin. As the processes involved in endocytosis and exocytosis probably are inconstant within one cell and certainly in different cell types, standardisation of cytoplasmic retention of heparin may not be possible in order to eliminate the partial overlap between normals, C.F. homozygotes and obligatory heterozygotes observed by Robertson et al. This report on 35S-heparin again raised the question of the significance of cellular mucopolysaccharides in cystic fibrosis. The relevance of mucopolysaccharides in the C.F. cultured cell is still unclear.

The known biochemical and physiological properties of C3a, together with the behavior of this purified substance when associated with IgG in our tracheal bioassay, compare favorably with those of molecular species which we have separated from sera and cell cultures of CF homozygotes and heterozygotes. Sera from normal healthy subjects, previously inactive by bioassay for ciliary dyskinesia factor (CDF), were converted to a CDF positive state by incubation with epsilon-amino-caproic-acid (EACA). EACA is a known inhibitor of the carboxypeptidase-B-like anaphylatoxin inactivator, and is the method of choice for accumulating anaphylatoxins in normal blood. Incubation of EACA-treated normal sera and two fresh CDF-positive CF sera with carboxypeptidase-B produced reversion in all instances to a CDF negative, normal state. It is proposed that anaphylatoxin inactivator, a carboxypeptidase-B-like enzyme, is defective or deficientin cystic fibrosis and that this deficiency is the primary gene defect.", "74124": "Rawal-B-D.

Because of possible complications in the erythrocytes from CF patients, and since the activity observed in a cell homogenate may not express the situation in the intact cell, we have looked for differences in the binding of 3H-ouabain in cultured normal and CF human diploid fibroblasts. We observed no appreciable differences in the number of ouabain-binding sites between normal and CF cell strains. We were also unable to observe any differences in the kinetics of ouabain-binding between normal and CF fibroblasts in K+-free phosphate-buffered saline solution, and the results were essentially the same as those seen in HeLa cells.

However this finding may not be very relevant to the Na+ transport defect occurring in this genetic disease. The Na+ transport abnormality in cystic fibrosis seems to be confined to exocrine glands. It is unknown at present whether the defect resides in an active or passive transport step of the cation. At least with isolated sweat gland tissue and erythrocytes from cystic fibrosis patients, Na+-K+ ATPase activity has been found to be normal. However a decrease in the ethacrynic acid-sensitive efflux, a Na+ exchange mechanism, has been reported in cystic fibrosis erythrocytes. These findings suggest that there is no fundamental abnormality in the Na+-K+ ATPase enzyme in the disease, but there may be a defect in an ethacrynic acid-sensitive transport step. Therefore in order to obtain a better understanding of the cation transport defect one should measure the binding of labelled ethacrynic-acid rather than ouabain.", "74127": "Rosenlund-M-L. Kim-H-K.

Elliott reported that intravenous administration of soybean oil and lecithin to children suffering from CF caused their sweat sodium concentration to decrease towards normal values. This prompted us to investigate the fatty acid spectra of the various serum lipid classes of children with CF. We have found that affected children are deficient in essential fatty acids. The data suggest another approach to the study of the metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis. There is an apparent deficiency in essential fatty acids, and a marked reduction in serum vitamin E levels has also been reported in CF. These conditions might be partially corrected by intravenous injection, or possibly feeding of, lipids containing essential fatty acids with concomitant administration of vitamin E. The observed deficiency in essential fatty acids may be produced by a reduced ability to absorb these acids from the diet and this, in turn, may result in defects in membrane structure or stability. Reduced levels of vitamin E in CF may reflect a reduced requirement for this vitamin because of the lower levels of essential fatty acids. It is also possible that the observed deficiency in serum levels of essential fatty acids may lead to less than normal production of prostaglandins.", "74128": "Rodgers-B. Ferholt-J.

Between hospital visits, it's also essential for warding off the primary threats of CF: pulmonary insufficiency and cor pulmonale. Treatment is palliative, focusing on supplying enzymes that the body can't secrete and, when the lungs are involved, clearing airway obstructions. The first step in therapy is starting the child on supplemental enzymes, which will enable him to absorb fat and protein. Usually we encourage a normal diet. If X-rays, pulmonary function tests, or clinical observation shows lung involvement, we initiate pulmonary therapy and teach parents how to perform it at home. Postural drainage is continued indefinitely, even if the lungs clear. If the child shows clinical signs of infection, we instruct the parents to increase the number of active mist and postural drainage treatments and to administer oral antibiotics in high doses.

This is in contrast to the more usual dietary sources of fats, long-chain triglycerides (LCT), which contain more than 14 carbon atoms in their atomic chain. The differences in chemical structure between LCT and MCT are important because they are related to major differences in the characteristics of absorption and metabolism of these two classes of lipids. These physiological differences between LCT and MCT have led to the use of MCT in various disorders where malabsorption of LCT occurs but where MCT can be absorbed because they bypass several of the steps necessary for the absorption of long chain fats. These include pancreatic disease, chronic liver disease, disorders of the biliary tract and diseases of the small intestinal epithelium and lymphatic vessels. The comments which follow are a brief summary of the therapeutic place of MCT in children with malabsorption. This will be followed by some remarks about the potential value of MCT in countries like Indonesia where the commonest cause of chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption in children is malnutrition and chronic and repeated gastrointestinal infections and infestations and where MCT has not been used widely.", "74135": "Gall-D-G.

This protein has a molecular weight of 12,000. It contains large numbers of serine, glycine, and glutamic acid residues, 0.85% phosphorus as phosphate monoester, and small amounts of carbohydrate. Precipitation (aggregation) of CaPP occurs at basic pH values in the presence of ionic calcium and is enhanced by increasing calcium concentration, CaPP concentration, or pH. Aggregated CaPP binds calcium in molar quantities equal to the number of phosphate prosthetic groups. Alkaline phosphatase removes all phosphate from CaPP and eliminates calcium-induced precipitation. Studies of CaPP from CF saliva have demonstrated no electrophoretic or compositional differences from normal CaPP. Higher than normal pH values or elevated CaPP concentrations are not present in SMS of patients with CF and do not contribute to the formation of turbid SMS. Aggregation and precipitation of CaPP in saliva of patients with CF seems to be induced primarily by elevated levels of calcium in saliva. This precipitation may be entirely, or in part, responsible for focal obstruction of submaxillary gland ducts in patients with CF.

The CF RBC is not helpful in defining a transport abnormality in that entity. These studies document normal intrinsic transport function in RBC of patients with CF. There have been reports of an abnormal serum factor in patients with CF. This factor might be involved in the production of a transport defect in CF. Further studies are indicated to determine whether CF plasma contains a factor capable of altering membrane transport functions of normal RBC.", "74142": "Rao-G-J.

BLOOD.Arginine esterase activity in chloroform-ellagic acid-treated plasma from 11 patients with cystic fibrosis(CF) and 12 age-matched control subjects has been resolved into its component fractions by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and electrofocusing on polyacrylamide gels. The activity can be resolved into two fractions by chromatography, one of which is inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) and the other of which is not inhibited by STI. In plasma of CF patients, the fraction of activity inhibited by STI is reduced to approximately 30% of the corresponding fraction in control plasma. In contrast, the fraction of activity resistant to inhibition by STI did not show any significant quantitative differences between control and CF plasma samples. Analysis of plasma samples by electrofocusing on 5% polyacrylamide gels in the range of pH 5.0-8.0 and subsequent staining for arginine esterase activity showed qualitative differences between control and CF plasma samples. Six activity bands could be detected in control samples, whereas five bands were detected in CF samples. Eight samples had one type of band missing, two had another type of band missing, and one had yet another type of band missing. All of these bands were restricted to a narrow pH zone in the center of the gel. These data are consistent with and extend our earlier reports of differences in arginine esterase activity between plasma samples of CF patients and control subjects. The demonstration of the absence of a single band of arginine esterase activity is consistent with the absence of a specific arginine esterase isoenzyme in patients with CF. The deficiency of arginine esterase in patients with cystic fibrosis may account for the presence of \"factors\" in saliva, plasma, and fibroblasts of these patients and consequently for the clinical manifestations of the disease.", "74143": "Barnett-D-R.

Cells from normal volunteers and patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were examined during exponential growth by incubation with L-(methyl-14C)methionine and (3H)uridine. The ratio of 14C to 3H counts per minute in isolated RNA serves as a measure of the extent of methylation and was found to be similar in normal and CF fibroblasts for tRNA, 18 S rRNA, and 28 S rRNA. Hydrolyzed samples of (14C)-methyl-labeled RNA species were analyzed by two dimensional chromatography and autoradiography. The methylated base and nucleoside compositions of tRNA and rRNA agree well with data for HeLa cells and other eurkaryote cells such as those from yeast, mouse, and chicken. RNA methylation patterns in CF fibroblasts were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed in normal cells for 4 S, 18 S, and 28 S RNA. There is no evidence that RNA species from patients with cystic fibrosis are deficient in any methylated components. Methylation of RNA by tissue-cultured cells from cystic fibrosis is qualitatively and quantitatively normal and will not prove to be a useful marker for identification of carriers of cystic fibrosis.", "74145": "Fox-W-W.

Fifteen CF patients and 24 controls were studied. Flow rates at 50% and 25% vital capacity (VC) were calculated from the air and helium-mixture MEFV curves and were compared to give flow ratios at these lung volumes. At 50% VC, the helium/air flow ratios were similar in CF patients and normal subjects. At 25% VC, the flow ratio was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the CF patients. The air and helium MEFV curves were superimposed and the point where the curves crossed (point of identical flow, PIF) was determined and expressed in % VC. For the CF patients, the mean PIF was 18% and for the controls, 5% (p < .001). Nine of the 15 CF patients had PIF values greater than 2 standard deviations (SD) from the normal mean. None of the following tests were abnormal in more than three patients: FEV1/FVC, MMEF, RV/TLC, Vmax 50% TLC (TLC/sec), and Vmax 25% VC (TLC/sec).

With these tremendous ranges many more subjects would be required to prove or disprove a difference. A difference undetectable in a moderate number of subjects is probably not of pathophysiologic significance if the Ca really varies unpredictably. Sweat Ca, however, is generally believed to vary with the rate of sweating, being much higher at lower rates, and measurements made at comparable rates might well show significant differences. The authors did attempt to control rate, but in a very inappropriate manner. They measured no constant rate, but took the average rate during the 30 minutes immediately after iontophoresis.

Two thirds of the CF patients with absent pancreatic enzymes lacked a serum pancreatic isoamylase band, while the remainder had a markedly diminished pancreatic band when compared to the salivary isoamylase. In normal sera the pancreatic band is equal to or greater than the salivary band. In all patients with absent enzymes the diagnosis of abnormal pancreatic function could have been made by evaluation of serum isoamylase patterns thereby avoiding duodenal intubation or collection of 72-hour stools for proteolytic enzyme activities. The patients with normal pancreatic enzyme activities had normal serum zymograms. No CF patient had a low total serum amylase concentration. Total duodenal fluid amylase levels may be misleading in the evaluation of pancreatic function since the amylase may be of salivary origin.

In 1971, Dolan and Gibson, in a retrospective study, reviewed the records of children with cystic fibrosis receiving chronic expectorant therapy with iodide and reported that approximately 85 percent had goiter and 15 percent suggestive clinical findings of hypothyroidism. This study, together with the fact that the thyroid, like lung and pancreas, is of endodermal origin raised the possibility that patients with cystic fibrosis might have an underlying defect in thyroid function. As thyroid function in patients with cystic fibrosis has not been evaluated in a systematic fashion, the present study was undertaken. In it, we have evaluated basal thyroid function in a large group of patients with cystic fibrosis and have, in addition, observed the effects of chronic iodide administration. The present study strongly suggests that there often occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis some derangement in thyroid hormone economy.

Special consideration is given to extraneous factors which can cause erroneous results in fluorometric analyses. A review of the older and current literature on the distribution of vitamin A in tissues is presented. Special consideration is given to the uptake of vitamin A by the liver and its storage in hepatocytes and Kupffer's cell and in subcellular organelles. Data on the concentration of vitamin A in the liver of victims of accidental death and the effect of diseases of several etiologies are presented. The mechanism by which liver stores of retinyl esters are mobilized and released to the plasma remains obscure. Considerable information has been gained recently on the mechanism by which retinol is transported in blood. Studies leading to the isolation and characterization of retinol transport proteins are summarized. The metabolism of retinol binding protein in health and in disease, especially in cystic fibrosis, is discussed. Finally, some factors of importance to the interpretation of plasma levels in terms of vitamin A are reviewed. Special attention is given to the effect on plasma levels of retinol and the retinol transport proteins of periods of rapid growth (correlations with age) and the influence of dietary adequacy on the distribution of plasma levels of the vitamin.", "74167": "Cichocki-T.

The PDs obtained in normal children were identical to those previously obtained in normal adults. A significantly greater dispersion of the values was observed in CFP. When the patients were divided into groups according to metachromasia in fibroblast cultures, the mean PD was increased only in the ametachromatic group. True enough, this observation suggests a difference between various forms of CFP, distinguished by metachromasia, and thus is a further indication of the heterogeneity of the disease. The greater abnormalities in metachromasia negative patients may, however, be due solely to the fact that these patients are more severely affected by the disease. The urinary excretion of tetrahydroaldosterone in patients was within the ranges obtained in controls, which excludes the possibility of secondary hyperaldosteronism as the source of increased PD. No evidence was provided in favour of a basic defect in the intestinal transport of Na+ or Cl minus, but K+ concentrations in faecal fluids of patients were significantly lower than in controls. The equilibrium concentration of K+ could be accounted for by simple passive diffusion, suggesting that the epithelium behaved inertly with respect to this ion in CFP.", "75006": "Darby-C-W.

We suggested this might be due to an alteration in the rectal mucosa potential or altered skin potential, or both, in cystic fibrosis. We measured skin and rectal charges directly by connecting our reference electrode to the blood stream through an intravenous line. Using this technique we showed that the cystic fibrosis patients (C.F.) have an abnormal perianal skin potential difference compared with readings we obtained in normal children. There was little difference in the transmural rectal potential difference between our cystic patients and previously reported values in normal adults.

Six of the sera contained group-specific antibodies which were revealed by only one of the antigen samples used and not by St-Ag. These six sera were further studied by means of various quantitative immunoelectrophoretic methods using St-Ag as well as antigens prepared from the infecting Ps. aeruginosa strain in the patient concerned. In all six sera, only one extra precipitin could be detected using antigens prepared from the homologous strain instead of St-Ag.

All the patients were followed in one clinic and the policy of antibiotic treatment was consistent during this period. The results show a dynamic situation where \"epidemic\" phage types during recent years have been gradually replaced by other types and, during the same period, the prevalence of strains resistant to more than one antibiotic decreased. Multiresistant strains including strains resistant to methicillin were infrequent in these patients. From 23 per cent of the patients, the same strains were repeatedly isolated for more than 1 year despite an apparently successful chemotherapy. Recently isolated strains were found to produce cellbound as well as extracellular protein A. Ninety-one per cent of the strains produced extracellular lipase and only 8 per cent were resistant to mercury chloride. Eighty-one per cent of the patients produced precipitating antibodies against S. aureus as judged by crossed immunoelectrophoresis.

This chapter will attempt to review the studies in both of these broad categories, which have led to the present concept that malnutrition during the growing period will permanently retard growth, resulting in a stunted individual, and markedly retard psychologic development, resulting in an individual with permanently altered behaviors.

Our experience with nutritional supplements other than the amino acid-glucose polymer mixture has been equally poor.

In comparison to the patients with cystic fibrosis, the patients with leukemia had a smaller HA antibody response, which lasted a shorter period of time, and also}i experienced greater toxicity from the vaccine. The mixing of adrenal corticosteroids with vaccine greatly decreased side reactions among the patients with leukemia without significantly inhibiting antibody production. Previous antineoplastic chemotherapy had little influence on antibody response in patients with leukemia, with the exception of methortrexate. Vaccinated patients with leukemia had 1 Pseudomonas infection of 14 bacterial or fungal infections, whereas 2 pseudomonas infections of 5 bacterial or fungal infections occurred in a control group of 20 patients with acute leukemia. Of the 12 patients with cystic fibrosis, 4 had a Pseudomonas infection after vaccination.", "75023": "Burnette-B-A.Family adjustment to cystic fibrosis.Am-J-Nurs. 1975 Nov. 75(11).

Diagnosis is mainly accomplished with an analysis of sweat for sodium and chloride ions. CF is transmitted as a Mendelian recessive trait. It is a generalized dysfunction of the endocrine glands. The abnormalities, seemingly unrelated, appear as loss of electrolytes through the sweat and salivary glands and as unusually thick, sticky mucus secretions that obstruct and damage the patient's pancreas, lungs, gallbladder, intestines, and liver.

Several lines of evidence indicate that fibroblasts express the presence of the CF genotype. Therefore these cells were used in an in vitro study directed at determining whether the manifestations of CF might be related to an alteration of one or more of the protein components of the plasma membrane. In order to evaluate the synthesis of these components, growing fibrosblasts from patients with CF and normal subjects were briefly exposed to either 14C- or 3-H-leucine.

The resulting values were compared with the alveolar- arterial PO2 difference, arterial PCO2, and standard measurements of lung volume, flow, and diffusing capacity. The arterial-alveolar PN2 difference was nearly one half of the PO2 difference, both early in the disease and at a more advanced stage. Analysis taking into account the O2 dissociation curve and the possibility that alveolar temperature is higher than sublingual temperature suggested that all of the PO2 difference could be explained in terms of ventilation- perfusion imbalance in gas-filled units of the lung. Reduction of fractional CO uptake with increasing PN2 difference suggested that the decrease in diffusing capacity in cystic fibrosis may be explained by ventilation-perfusion inequality. A significant relationship between arterial PCO2 and the PN2 difference supported the view that ventilation-perfusion inequality is the cause of CO2 retention when present. The PN2 and PO2 differences were abnormal before the standard tests of lung volume and flow, but in general, the correlation was excellent. Because the PN2 difference was not superior to the PO2 difference in detecting early disease, and because the technical problems in its measurement are considerable, it is not recommended as a routine measurement.", "75027": "Stowe-S-M.

Open thoracotomy had the advantage of insuring prompt resolution of the pneumothorax. A small incision minimized postoperative morbidity. The average hospital stay was 15 days after open thoracotomy and 19 days after closed thoracostomy, with or without sclerosing agents. Complications of all treatments were infrequent. A limited symptomatic recurrence was observed in 2 of 17 pneumothoraces successfully treated with open thoracotomy. Recurrence also occurred in 1 of 8 treated with observation, 3 of 9 treated with closed thoracostomy, and 1 of 14 treated with closed thoracostomy and sclerosing agents. A loss of vital capacity was usually noted 4 to 18 months after resolution, regardless of treatment. Forty per cent of patients in both operative and nonoperative groups survived 3 years.

Lung volumes, maximal expiratory flow-volume curves breathing air and then breathing a helium-oxygen mixture, and single- breath nitrogen washouts were measured. Forced expiratory maneuvers from lung volumes near functional residual capacity were performed to produce transients of flow exceeding maximal flow defined by the full flow-volume curve. Normal children and those with asthma and mild cystic fibrosis had small or no transients. Those with severe cystic fibrosis had large transients as well as increased phase I on the nitrogen washout curves. These large transients were associated with increased curvilinearity of the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve and smaller than normal flow response breathing helium. In severe cystic fibrosis, the large transients suggest sequential emptying of fast and slow spaces, which influences the shape of the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve. The fast space could be due to compression of an enlarged anatomic dead space. Any time constant inequality between parenchymal units present in asthma and mild cystic fibrosis does not appear to contribute significantly to the shape of the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve.", "75029": "Wood-R-E.

This review is confined to discussion of certain aspects of several genetically acquired diseases of metabolism which the anaesthesiologist may be called upon to manage in the pediatric patient. Every genetic metabolic disease is the result of a specific enzyme defect (or defects) in function or in amount. In this review, diseases in which defects are known (e.g., homocystinuria), suspected (e.g., myotonia congenita), and unknown (e.g., cystic fibrosis) are discussed. Therapeutic approaches to genetic metabolic disease include: supplying the missing product; preventing substrate accumulation; preventing alternate product synthesis; enzyme induction; enzyme replacement; increasing deficient function with cofactor administration; and compensatory therapy. Obviously, the ideal way to treat the consequences of a genetic disease is to normalize the patient biochemically. For diseases where the pathophysiology is clear, this goal is approachable; for conditions where the pathophysiology is unknown, only compensatory therapy is possible.", "75032": "Lamm-L-U.

SALIVA: de.A phenomenon associated with the genetic disease of cystic fibrosis (CF) is the presence of a serum factor that stops or discoordinates ciliary beating. This effect has been demonstrated by exposing freshwater mussel or oyster gill cilia, or rabbit tracheal cilia, to sera from homozygous or heterozygous cystic fibrosis subjects. Assay reproducibility is unsatisfactory, however, and the mechanism of the effect is not understood. Nor do we know why there may be considerable differences between the activity of tested heterozygotes and of homozygotes. Because the ciliary assay is capricious, there is a need to understand how ciliary beating is disturbed or stopped. Since microtubules are important in the mechanism of ciliary motion, they could conceivably show alterations during the response to inhibitory substances. There has been no ultrastructural study, however, of the effects of ciliary inhibition on the axonemal components. Therefore, this study was designed to examine ciliary structure during the different stages of ciliary inhibition. Rapid microtubular disappearance and reappearance occurs in the terminal cilia of the freshwater mussel Unio when exposure to CF serum causes a shock-stop reaction, and return to water allows resumption of normal ciliary beating. In contrast, a slow-stop reaction causes distortion of cilia, asynchronous beating, and ejection of cells from the distal gill filament, but ciliary axonemal structure is preserved. Slow-stopped cilia do not resume their beating in water. Saliva from reserpine-treated rats causes ciliary inhibition similar to that induced by CF serum.", "75036": "McDougal-W-S.

The symptoms and signs which allow for a positive prospective diagnosis are illustrated by comparing this disease to those entities with which it is most often confused, e.g. diffuse peritonitis of other etiologies, and include a short duration of symptoms, associated urinary tract infection and an absence of free air on abdominal roentgenograms. In the past, gram positive organisms were the most common infecting agent; however, in this series gram negative bacteria accounted for 69% or the organisms.

A review of this literature reveals that the nonmedical participants in this debate were preoccupied with those aims of genetics that might benefit (or threaten) society, while the physicians were concerned with the accomplishment of standard medical missions in which social aims figure only incidentally. These missions are diagnosis, management, and prevention of disease. The specific uses of genetic knowledge most frequently mentioned were advances in the taxonomy of disease that lead to improvements in diagnosis and treatment of individual patients and their relatives, genetic counseling, and genetic screening.

Duodenal fluid mean total bile acid concentrations were within normal limits. Estimation of serum bile acids in these 6 patients showed that 3 patients had raised serum bile acid values.

We question whether the increase in essential fatty acids brought about by soya oil can account for the favourable course of the disease in this patient. Our own observations confirm that essential fatty acids levels are often below normal in cystic fibrosis, but they do not correlate with the clinical condition of the patient. It seems unlikely that minor degrees of essential fatty acid deficiency would impair prostaglandin synthesis, or give rise to the usual clinical features of cystic fibrosis. - Our own more recent research in platelet aggregation, prostaglandin, and cyclic nucleotide production, makes us aware that simple EFA deficiency per se cannot be the origin of the symptoms of CF. The possibility that some other agent in the infusion mixture (which, for example, contains about 12% tocopherol) may be a contributing factor, is also under investigation. This does not, however, invalidate a possible therapeutic effect of EFA in the disease, and in particular, a partial correlation of a possible disorder of prostaglandin synthesis.", "75043": "Kjellman-N-I.

PHYSICAL-THERAPY.Reports of children with cystic fibrosis living well whilst on intensive treatment can be covered by allegations that their disease must be basically mild. More revealing evidence comes from the longterm survival studies done by Professor Warren Warwick, of the University of Minnesota. The introduction of antibiotics have allowed the children to live loner, but 3/4 were dead by aged 10 years. Physiotherapy given after infections prolonged lives so that half were still alive at 10 years - but still faced a relentless death rate. Prophylactic - daily - physiotherapy produced a doubling of survival at 20 years from under 30% to over 60%.

VAGINA: ab.We have recently proposed a classification of the disorders of sexual development based upon the presumed site of action of the abnormal gene during embryogenesis. These disorders, which may be either genetic or nongenetic in nature, are the result of disturbances in the physiology of sexual differentiation during embryogenesis. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current physiologic concepts of normal sexual differentiation, to review the known hereditary disorders of sexual development, and to consider briefly the implications that these mutations have for the understanding of normal sexual differentiation. The translation of genetic sex into phenotypic sex is a complex process. Since some 19 hereditary, single-gene determined disorders of sexual development are currently recognized that involve loci on both the autosomes and the X chromosome, it can be inferred that at a minimum 19 genes and hence 19 discrete biochemical steps are involved in this process. At least 10 mutations result in male pseudohermaphroditism, whereas only 2 mutations are known to cause female pseudohermaphroditism. The predominance of male type of mutation is the result of the fact that the formation of the male phenotype is actively induced by the secretions of the fetal testis whereas the formation of the female phenotype does not require secretion from the fetal ovary. The end result of these mutations that involve the formation and action of testosterone can be similar, and it requires anatomic, endocrinologic, and genetic study of individual patients to identify the mutant genes involved. Undoubtedly, many more as yet unidentified genes must participate in sexual differentiation. The identification of these genes will depend on the continued delineation of new simply inherited clinical syndromes. Any fundamental understanding of the programming of events in phenotypic differentiation will require not only the identification of the genes involved but the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which each of these genes is expressed.", "75050": "Zaidi-Z-H.Letter: Serum alpha-fetoprotein in cystic fibrosis.Br-Med-J. 1975 Aug 23. 3(5981).

Observers in the U.K. have been unable to confirm these findings, whereas Dr. J. A. Smith of New York supports them. Perhaps the crux of the matter lies in the technique of estimating serum AFP. if a small number of families is analysed the proportion of affected individuals may differ from the expected. By chance some families may have all normal children whereas some may have all affected children. For example, nowadays, since families tend to be small, the appearance of an autosomal recessive condition is often sporadic with only one affected person in the family.

By counterimmunoelectrophoresis we were unable to detect an increased serum concentration of AFP in any of the cystic fibrosis patients or their relatives.

The corresponding level in the patients was 433 (range 80 - 1055) microg/l. Drug therapy given to these patients may have a subtle hepatoxic influence, thereby causing a rise in AFP levels.

In contrast, the meconium test for detecting homozygote newborns is simple, inexpensive, reasonably specific but its general application has yet to be evaluated. Detection of serum components is the basis of two new tests to distinguish patients with cystic fibrosis and carriers. The effect of these serum components on ciliary activity is the principle of one test, an extremely difficult procedure that is subjective and lacks sufficient specificity for routine use.

The present study was undertaken to find whether the use of medium from short term white blood cell or skin fibroblast cultures, rather than serum, as the test sample would eliminate such inconsistencies. Short term white blood cell cultures were established from 107 normal, healthy individuals. Cultures from 97 had no CFFA, six (No. 1-6) showed variable results and four (No. 7-10) had activity in all four tests done on a single sample. When the assays were repeated 3 months later on new cultures from these four positive CFFA individuals, two showed activity (Nos. 7 & 9) and two did not (Nos. 8 & 10). All 10 individuals whose cultures showed CFFA has histories of allergies. The association of CFFA in the culture medium derived from individuals having allergies with the intermittent presence of this activity suggested that environmental factors induced a CFF-like activity in such white blood cell cultures. The oyster ciliary assay, using medium from white blood cell cultures, cannot be used for screening for the CF heterozygote since the substitution of culture medium for serum did not eliminate inconsistent results and CFFA was not specific by this assay for the CF gene.

Garamycin pediatric injectable, containing 10 mg/ml of the active ingredient, was administered intravenously to all patients in divided doses of 3.0 to 5.0 mg/kg/day. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of garamycin when administered parenterally to cystic fibrosis patients with serious infections. During the 100 courses of treatment, clinical improvement was rated as follows: significant or definite improvement, 39; moderate improvement, 50; slight improvement, 9; and no change, 2.

Genuine recognition of feelings by the pediatric staff can go a long way toward reassuring family members that their long-standing burden and suffering are being validated and understood. When a family manifests early signs of difficulty in coping with the emotional and physical stress imposed by cystic fibrosis, it is helpful to refer them to a child psychiatrist for consultation. It is primarily the families at high risk for breakdown which most require early prevention and intervention. The role of the pediatrician as the primary clinician is crucial.

Although some parts of knowledge gained from adult studies can be used, chronic cor pulmonale in children and infants is quite a different entity from that usually seen in adults.

In two previous studies from this hospital (Lykkegaard & Jacobsen 1975, Lykkegaard & Thuesen Pedersen 1975) the clinical, radiological, and functional severity of the lung disease and the serum protein pattern in CF patients were studied in relation to classes of skin fibroblast metachromasia.

Sproul and Huang (1964), in a study of growth patterns in cystic fibrosis, found a significant correlation between severity of the respiratory disease and height and weight retardation.

Fourteen patients belonged to class I (vesicular metachromasia), 52 to class II (generalized metachromasia), and 32 to class III (no metachromasia). All patients above 16 years of age (six patients) were class II. Simple scoring systems for clinical lung symptoms and for treatment of lung disease were developed. When compared at the same ages, class I and III patients were more severely affected (judged by the clinical lung symptoms) than class II patients, and they had been more intensively treated. Comparing class I + II patients (metachromatic fibroblasts) with class III patients (ametachromatic fibroblasts), it was found that class III patients were more severely affected and had been more intensively treated than class I + II patients. As regards chest radiographs (judged by Norman's system) a similar pattern was seen, but no statistically significant differences were found. In 68 patients (9 of class I, 35 of class II, and 24 of class III) the serum protein electrophoretic fractions were studied. It was found that class III patients had more severe alterations than class II patients, and more than class I + II patients. The proportion of female patients in class III was greater than in the other two classes, but this could not explain the differences.

Trypsin-like activity in mixed and parotid saliva showed large individual variations in CF and normal children. In parotid saliva we could not find any significant difference, whereas a reduction of TLA in mixed saliva of CF patients was observed. The fact that our normal values fell within the range of heterozygotes reported by Rao et al. (19), makes their hypothesis of a close relationship between reduced TLA and the genetic defect very doubtful. Protein, calcium and pH increased with augmented salivation and no difference between CF patients and normal age matched children could be found except for the pH at a flow rate above 0.75 ml/min per m2 body surface where significantly lower pH values resulted.

In general, polyps were not observed in those patients with severe disease. Mild degrees of conductive hearing loss were noted in the younger age groups especially, but no instance of severe hearing loss or nerve conduction disturbance was encountered. Such mild degrees of hearing loss may merely reflect the application of standards too stringent for this age group.

Further studies were necessary to investigate the clinical reliability of increased 59Fe2 absorption in patients with erythroblastic hyperplasia, which may control the regulation of iron absorption by iron stores. The relationship between iron absorption and iron stores was studied in pancreatic insufficiency to reinvestigate the effect of pancreatic secretion on iron absorption. Iron absorption in patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy was investigated in order to correlate the impairment of iron absorption with the degree of villous atrophy and to study its recovery on a gluten-free diet. Dietary iron absorption was measured in patients with gastric mucosal atrophy and partial gastrectomy to investigate the extent to which iron malabsorption is responsible for the high incidence of iron deficiency in such patients. The combination of the diagnostic 59Fe2 absorption test and measurement of the whole body 59Fe2 elimination rate is a useful routine procedure for the detection and quantification of gastrointestinal or urogenital blood loss as a cause of iron deficiency.", "75086": "Chandra-R-K.Alpha-fetoprotein in serum and amniotic fluid in the diagnosis of neonatal hepatitis syndrome, Indian childhood cirrhosis, cystic fibrosis, ataxia telangiectasia and spina bifida.Indian-Pediatr. 1975 Jul. 12(7).

No significant differences were observed between children with cystic fibrosis and those with tracheostomy. Since intramuscular injection of gentamicin (a single dose of 1.5 mg/kg) resulted in low levels of gentamicin within the bronchial secretions (less than 2 mug/ml in 10 patients, among whom 4 had undetectable levels); it is concluded that the administration of an antibiotic such as gentamicin, directly to the trachea by endotracheal injection or by aerosolization might prove to be helpful when the infection is confined mainly to the tracheo-bronchial tree.", "75088": "Arad-I.

Through this system an annual up-dated and corrected data base has been prepared for cystic fibrosis patients seen at U.S.A. Centers from 1966 through 1972. From the data base, a large number of life table studies are calculated. A study is specified by its data base, the observation period, analysis age (age year or year since diagnosis), the Centers included, and the condition of patients at birth, and possible additional factors such as sex, age at diagnosis, or race. The annual rates of mortality are measured by a force of mortality technique. Two techniques have been used to appraise the mortality of particular groups, graphing the cumulative survival function for the group together with the cumulative survival function for a comparative group, and calculation of mortality ratios of actual to expected deaths (by an applicable standard mortality table). This latter approach lends itself readily to tests of significance. For the purpose of calculating mortality ratios, two standard tables have been prepared on the basis of the 1972 Data Base and the 1966-1972 observations. The first of these standard tables is for use with age year studies, and the second is for years since diagnosis studies. The paper comments on the number of mortality studies by calendar year, by sex, by condition at birth, by age at diagnosis, and of survival from diagnosis of patients diagnosed in 1966-1972. The calendar year studies indicate an improvement trend in the survival experience from 1966 to 1972 but a change may be occurring. The study by sex exhibits a higher female mortality. The 7% of patients who have meconium ileus at birth show a significantly higher first-year mortality, and a somewhat lower survival rate thereafter even if the first year of life experience is excluded. Mortality data for groups specified by age at diagnosis are given. For patients diagnosed during 1966-1972, there is some indication of better survival than for patients diagnosed prior to 1966. The continuation of these mortality studies on an annual basis should further our understanding of survival patterns for cystic fibrosis patients.", "75093": "Murad-F. Moss-W-W. Johanson-J.

SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-P-H-S.The urinary excretion of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) was examined in 98 normal children and 46 children with cystic fibrosis between the ages of 9 months and 18 yr. Diurnal variations in cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP excretion were observed in subjects from either group, and peak levels of cyclic nucleotide excretion were generally observed during the period of 0700 to 2100 h. Excretion rates (mumol/day) of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP increased significantly with age. When cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP excretion rates were normalized for urinary creatine, or body weight, the values declined significantly with age in both groups of patients. Cyclic GMP excretion normalized for body surface area also decreased with age, while the value for cyclic AMP (2.86 plus or minus 0.08 mumol/day/m2, mean plus or minus SE) was constant with age in both normals and cystic fibrosis children. With some comparisons of age groups there were significant differences in cyclic nucleotide excretion between normal subjects and children with cystic fibrosis. The differences noted were dependent upon the methods used to normalize excretion rates (urinary creatine, body weight, surface area, and the ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP excreted). In general patients with cystic fibrosis excreted greater amounts of cyclic GMP than did normals. The most striking comparison was the ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP excreted which was 9.09 plus or minus 0.50 in all normal children and 4.41 plus or minus 0.32 in children with cystic fibrosis (P smaller than 0.001).", "75094": "Zierdt-C-H.

SPECIES-SPECIFICITY.Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (173) from 144 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) of the pancreas in seven hospitals were serotyped with the agglutination systems of Homma (1974) and Fisher et al. (1969). The two systems were complementary. Strains from CF patients were much less likely to furnish a stable type on repetitive typing tests than strains from other patients. This was related to the frequent occurrence of mucoid P. aeruginosa strains. The 173 strains were divided among 11 Homma serotypes. A single Homma type (type 8) capable of mucoid growth comprised 104 (60%) CF strains. Eight serotypes were detected in 77 strains from 48 CF patients in one hospital; three strains were detected in one hospital CF unit; and two strains were detected in each of five hospital CF units. The CF serotype comprised from 50 to 93% of CF strains in the seven hospitals. These P. aeruginosa strains dissociated in vivo as judged by mucoid and nonmucoid colonies on primary culture plates and continued to dissociate during subcultures. Both colony type were the same serotype. The tendency to regard colonial phenotypes (mucoid, nonmucoid, rough) as separate strains was erroneous. Repetitive typing with the two systems gave better results than a single system. The mucoid P. aeruginosa strain is probably spread from patient to patient, rather than acquiring its mucoid characteristic de novo in the CF patient. It is not known why the mucoid CF strain has a peculiar predilection for CF patients, nor why it generally loses the quality in culture but retains it indefinitely in the patient.", "75095": "Green-M.

TERATOMA: me.An alpha-feto-protein (AFP) is present in many mammals, in birds, and in sharks during development. The AFP present in different species have similar physicochemical properties and often have common antigenic determinants. Their study, both in health and disease, has provided a useful model for the understanding of other phase-specific antigens and the activation of the genes which control their synthesis. In the human fetus, the level of AFP falls with increasing maturity. The more sensitive methods of detection have disclosed that this fetal protein persists in trace amounts throughout life and its level increases in maternal blood during pregnancy. The principal sites of synthesis are the fetal liver and in some mammals, the yolk sac splanchnopleur. In humans as well as in mice and cows, it is notable that the synthesis of AFP is increased in liver cancer cells and that high levels of this protein are present in serum. Elevated values of AFP have also been detected in human subjects with undifferentiated tumours of the testis and ovary. A fall to normal levels has been noted in cases of complete remission after surgery and a return to high levels in patients who develop metastases. In some patients with hepatitis a temporary rise in the level of AFP has also been observed. In recent years, the detection of high levels of AFP in amniotic fluid has proved to be of great value for the prenatal diagnosis of neural-tube defects. Abnormal levels have also been found in the amniotic fluid or in maternal serum in cases of spontaneous abortion.

The frequency distributions of salt taste sensitivity for patients with cystic fibrosis are given. Normal siblings and control patients did not differ statistically, and they were combined into a single control group for analyses. The patients with cystic fibrosis did not differ as a group from the normal subjects in salt sensitivity. There were, however, two children with cystic fibrosis with taste sensitivities well below those observed among the normal children. No age or sex differences in sensitivity were observed. The taste sensitivity of the children with cystic fibrosis did not correlate with the Shwachman and Kulczycki rating of the severity of their disease. Of the seven children who had determinations of sweat electrolytes at the time of taste testing, three failed to excrete sufficient amounts for measurements. Patients with cystic fibrosis, as a group, were not found to have more sensitive taste acuity than normal. This corroborates the findings of Wotman and associates and strongly suggests that a general abnormality of the taste system is not routinely symptomatic of cystic fibrosis. Henkin and Powell hypothesized that extremely acute taste is related to elevations in the concentration of electrolytes in sweat. This seems unlikely since the patients given sweat tests in the present study all had the high levels of sodium and chloride characteristic of cystic fibrosis, yet all had taste sensitivities in the normal range. Wotman and associates suggested that perhaps the severity of the disease accounts for the appearance of hypersensitivity in the chemoreceptive systems. The clinical ratings of the severity of the disease did not correlate with taste sensitivity.", "75103": "Baig-M-M. Cetorelli-J-J.

Yet, had the original observation of Cantacuzene on the large common edible spider crab been followed, this remarkable sensitivity of marine arthropod blood to endotoxin would have been recognized much earlier. The original work of Metchnikoff on sea star larvae stimulated him to develop the major theory of phagocytosis but, until the adult animal of the same genus was re-examined half a century later, the presence of a powerful substance which selectively inhibits growth of lymphocytes following primary immunization remained unknown. Though mucus secretion is a fundamental characteristic of most invertebrate phyla and all vertebrates, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of the secretory process; studies of the responses of specialized invertebrate secretory cells to infection have now led to a new means of studying macromolecular control of mucus secretion in man.

OXIDATION-REDUCTION.I have measured the fatty-acid profile of C.F. erythrocyte membranes in view of the fact that some variations in membrane activity have been observed with this system. The results show that there was a lowered content of linoleate (18:2) and arachidonate (20:4) in C.F. erythrocyte membranes, and the total essential-fatty-acid content was significantly lower than either control group. There was no significant difference in the concentrations of the other major fatty acids (palmitate, stearate, and oleate) and we could not observe any striking alteration in the concentration of any of the minor fatty-acid components of the membrane. It would thus appear that the overall fatty-acid pattern in C.F. erythrocyte membranes is altered only by a diminution in those fatty acids which are of dietary origin. The fact that there was considerable overlap between the C.F. and control data makes it rather unlikely that the fatty-acid profile closely reflects the biochemical lesion of the disease. When the essential-fatty-acid levels of the C.F. samples were compared with the Schwachman clinical scores of the patients, there was a surprisingly poor correlation (r = 0.49) which was not statistically significant. The correlation with the nutritional part of the clinical score was equally low. Diminished essential-fatty-acid content is often observed in many acute illnesses. In addition, the possibility exists that C.F. patients may be particularly susceptible to essential-fatty-acid depletion due to their pancreatic dysfunction.

His control group, however, was composed of subjects with bronchiectasis or chronic bronchitis, in whom C.F. had been ruled out. The use of a more proper control group by Lieberman, either in place of or in parallel with his \"diseased\" control groups, would have provided a more meaningful interpretation concerning the role of complement in cystic fibrosis. We agree that there is a tendency for C3 to be higher in C.F. females than in C.F. males. Although Lieberman was quick to dispel any notion of C3a being implicated in the aetiology of C.F., he overlooked the one facet of our initial study that still makes our hypothesis feasible - raised C3 levels in C.F. obligate heterozygotes. Hann et al. reported that serum-C5 was raised in both C.F. patients and their parents. Our initial data on C5 levels by radial immunodiffusion and haemolytic studies do not confirm this finding.

HUMAN.Mr Stuart and Dr Burdon speculate on the possibility that the high frequency of the cystic-fibrosis gene among Caucasians may be due to the heterozygotes having some advantage in biological fitness over normal homozygotes. They suggest that this might be due to increased resistance to typhus, once endemic in Europe, on the basis of the well-known immunological cross-reactivity between the causative organism, Rickettsia prowazeki, and certain strains of the species Proteus vulgaris, which is agglutinated by sera from cystic-fibrosis patients and heterozygotes. However, there is no evidence that this agglutination is an immunological reaction. It appears microscopically to be associated with disorganisation and inhibition of the bacterial flagellae leading to clumping of the organisms. As such it is probably analogous to the effect on cilia of rabbit trachea and oyster or mussel gills. The cilia factor, although associated with IgG, is now known not to be IgG itself and may well be the C3a component of complement. These and other observations, such as those on salivary and sweat gland secretions and on sodium flux, suggest that all these phenomena are membrane rather than immunological effects. Although it is possible that a Proteus flagella antigen could also be the binding site for the cilia factor, this seems improbable. An alternative hypothesis is that heterozygotes for the cystic-fibrosis gene have increased resistance to tuberculosis. This would meet the requirement of a common disease recently endemic in Europe at least as well as typhus, and is suggested by indirect evidence from a family study demonstrating a significantly lower incidence of tuberculosis among the parents of cystic-fibrosis patients than among parents of controls.", "75116": "Editorial: Pseudomonas vaccines.Lancet. 1975 Jul 26. 2(7926).

The results show that for children with cystic fibrosis there are not only decreased proportions of essential fatty acids but that 20:3 omega-9 is found in all cases. Our results suggest that there is no intrinsic defect of the desaturating system in cystic fibrosis and that the pattern of essential-fatty-acid deficiency is entirely similar to that found in dietary deficiency of essential fatty acids. A further significant finding is the occurance if 20:3 omega-9 in apparently healthy children, particularly the very young. This is probably diet-related and emphasises the young child's very large requirement for essential fatty acids for membrane synthesis. The need for adequate polyunsaturated fatty acids in childhood cannot be overstated, whether they be for normal membrane synthesis or lowering of serum-lipids, giving possible protection against cardiovascular disease.", "75121": "Robinson-P-G.Letter: Essential fatty acids in cystic fibrosis.Lancet. 1975 Nov 8. 2(7941).

Similarly the percentage lowering is also more for L.A. than A.A. There is, thus, no \"overwhelming\" evidence for a blocked or absent desaturase and the cause of the E.F.A. deficiency must be elsewhere. We have found up to 2.5% of the total fatty acids in both serum and red cells to be C20:3-omega-9. All of our C.F. patients have shown this acid at some stage and, for most, it is a permanent feature of their fatty acid profile. It has been reported that C20:3-omega-9 would probably act as an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation from A.A. and it is interesting to conjecture on whether this could account for some of the symptoms of C.F.

To substantiate their hypothesis they deduce that the remarkable remission observed in a cystic-fibrosis patient given intravenous 'Intralipid' was due not to the 18:2 content of the 20% triglyceride component of the fat emulsion but to the 20:4 content of its 1.2% phospholipid component (not 6% as they state). This explanation seems unlikely in view of the relatively small proportion of 20:4 in intralipid phospholipid, especially since intravenous administration of intralipid phospholipid to healthy subjects decreases both the 18:2 and 20:4 content of their plasma-phospholipids. Comparison of the effects of complete intralipid versus intralipid phospholipid on the level of 20:4 in the plasma-phospholipids of patients with cystic fibrosis would soon determine whether they lack the ability to desaturate 18:2 to 20:4.", "75125": "Robinson-P-G.

The differences suggest a reduction in the desaturation of E.F.S. It is not known whether this defect is the primary lesion in C.F. or is the result of tissue damage in the disease.

Medications containing iodide may induce hypothroidism in euthyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 131I or surgically treated Graves' disease, or following hemithyroidectomy for nodules; and they may induce hyperthyroidism in patients with endemic iodine- deficient goiter, autonomous nodules or nontoxic nodular goiter, or in patients recently treated with antithyroid drugs for Graves' disease. Rarely, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism may develop in patients with completely normal thyroid function during administration of iodide. The etiology of iodide-induced goiter and hypothyroidism in patients with cystic fibrosis remains obscure. Iodide-induced myxedema may also occur in patients receiving drugs which alter thyroid function, such as lithium, phenazone, and sulfisoxazole.

MISSOURI.Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a generalized disorder of the exocrine glands inherited as a recessive genetic trait. The disease was more fully described as a specific entity in 1939 with a pathology of dilated ducts and fibrotic changes in the pancreas and copious secretory intraluminal obstruction of the bronchial tree. The symptoms predominately involve the gastrointestinal tract as more frequent, bulky, malformed and malodorous stools and the respiratory system as cough, wheezing and signs of chronic respiratory obstruction. In certain instances, only one of these two systems will have manifest symptoms and signs. An increased concentration of sodium and chloride in the sweat was discovered in 1953. The elevated salt concentration of the sweat has proven to be a reliable diagnostic tool to confirm the presence of the disease. Few diseases present in so many different forms, degrees of severity and at different ages as does CF. All present treatments for cystic fibrosis are essentially symptomatic. Since the study of families having a child with cystic fibrosis has shown an incidence of the disease in one fourth of their siblings, classification of the disease as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder suggests that the concept of an abnormal gene related to alteration in a single enzyme should apply.

A number of early synonyms included congenital steatorrhea, pancreatic infantilism, and pancreatic fibrosis. The concern of the pediatrician in the late 1930's and early 1940's was to distinguish nonfatal celiac disease from fatal cystic fibrosis. In 1954, Shwachman presented clinical and laboratory features that distinguish these two entities. Today one is not justified in making a diagnosis of celiac disease without a confirmatory small intestinal biopsy coupled with a normal sweat test. A number of gastrointestinal complications in cystic fibrosis are examined: meconium ileus, intestinal obstruction, pancreatic insufficiency, lactase deficiency, intestinal impaction, intussusception, rectal prolapse, growth retardation, excessive appetite, cirrhosis and portal hypertension, gallbladder problems, and diabetes.

The assay employs isoelectric focusing in thin layer polyacrylamide gels to analyze microliter quantities of whole serum for the presence of a C/F factor protein and for deletions in a group of proteins called proteins B, C, and D (Fig, 1). A pH 5-10 gradient is used (Fig. 2) and each sample is screened using a serum volume which contains 300 g immunoglobulin G (IgG). Individuals homozygous or heterozygous for C/F are distinguished from normal unaffected individuals on the basis of the presence of a C/F factor protein band (Table 1). Heterozygous carriers for C/F are distinguished from C/F homozygotes 75 percent of the time, on the basis of a deletion in either band B, C, or D (Table 2). On the basis of screening 65 patients with cystic fibrosis, 61 heterozygous carriers for C/F, and 105 normal control subjects, it was concluded that no obvious correlation existed between either sex, age, or severity of the disease in the individual C/F patient, and the absolute presence or absence of the C/F factor. In addition, no correlation existed between sex or age and the presence of the C/F factor or deletions in proteins B, C, and D in the individual heterozygous carrier for C/F or normal control subjects. Analysis of serum samples from 68 patients with a variety of other diseases, many with clinical symptoms resembling those seen in the patient with cystic fibrosis (Table 3), indicated that the C/F factor protein described in this study appears to be diagnostic for C/F genotypes, with the possible exception of patients with certain types of leukemia.", "75139": "Rao-G-J.

TRACHEA: cy.The ability of epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA)-treated normal serum and of cystic fibrosis (CF)-affected and carrier sera to promote the release of lysosomal enzymes from sensitized human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) was assessed through the measurement of beta- glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase activity after exposure of these cells to the various test sera. This study was initiated to extend the analogies between preciliary dyskinesia factor (pre-CDF), separated from the cell-free media of cultures derived from CF homozygous and heterozygous individuals, and C3a anaphylatoxin. The extent of lysosomal degranulation of human PMN exposed to fresh untreated sera of each of five controls, seven CF homozygotes, and eight heterozygotes, as expressed by the amount of beta-glucuronidase releases, was 7.84% (+/- 0.934) for control sera, 14.01% (+/- 1.79) for CF-affected sera, and 10.61% (+/- 1.43) for heterozygous sera. The difference between CF homozygotes and control subjects is significant (P less than 0.0001), as is the difference between CF- affected and carrier individuals (0.001 less than P less than 0.005) and between control subjects and carriers (0.001 less than P less than 0.005), when beta-glucuronidase. However, the differences between control subjects and CF heterozygous individuals are not significant. Treatment of these sera with 1 M EACA gave values for beta-glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase release which are slightly reduced when compared with those obtained with fresh, untreated samples. EACA apparently reduces the activity of beta-glucuronidase released from PMN. Amicon filtration studies of these serum samples demonstrated that degranulating ability and the presence of cilicary dyskinesia, as assessed by rabbit tracheal bioassay, are not always associated. Therefore, the relationship between pre-CDF and the degranulator activity in native CF-affected and carrier sera is unclear, in part because of the limitations inherent in the test systems employed.", "75141": "Shapiro-B-L.

TIME-FACTORS.Serum glutathione reductase (NADPH-GSSG oxidoreductase, EC. 1.6.4.2 (GR)) has been examined in cystic fibrosis subjects (CF), obligate CF heterozygotes, and control subjects. Serum protein concentration was similar in the three groups. Regardless of the units used to express activity (milligrams of protein or milliliters of serum) or whether or not samples were dialyzed against water or phosphate buffer, mean serum GR in CF was greater than in control subjects (P less than or equal to 0.002) in all series over several years. Under the above assay conditions no difference in serum GR between control subjects and carriers was detected. Calculated and assayed values of combined control and CF sera agreed as did expected and observed 50% activity in 1:2 sera dilutions in CF, control subjects, and carriers. Addition of FAD to incubation media did not effect enzyme activity in the three groups. Differences between CF and control subjects persisted after dialysis in membranes permitting passage of molecules of approximately 12,000 mol wt or less. These findings would tend to exclude the effect of extraneous serum factors in explaining the differences between CF and control subjects. The percentage of initial GR activity after four days storage (0-4 degrees) was significantly greater in CF than in control subjects (P less than 0.025). The effect of heparin on serum GR was recorded as the percentage of activity after incubation with heparin vs. activity in the standard assay for individual subjects. The effect of incubation with 5 mug/ml heparin on serum GR activity was greater in control subjects than in carriers (P less than 0.0005) and CF (P less than 0.0005). Mean serum GR activity in CF and carriers was unaffected by heparin, whereas mean activity in control subjects was decreased. In no control was the percentage of initial activity with heparin greater than the mean of CF and carrier groups. Only 3 of 20 CF and 4 of 20 carrier individuals had percentages lower than the control mean. The CF and carrier distributions were clearly different from the control distribution. Serum GR was determined in seven non-CF individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Activity in the COPD was different from CF and no different from control subjects. In none of these controls or COPD was serum GR as great as the CF mean. Serum GR in no CF was as low as the mean of control subjects or COPD. It is concluded that serum GR activity is greater in CF than in control subjects, carriers, and non-CF COPD subjects; that the difference in activity is not attributable to an extraneous serum factor, that the activity difference is not secondary to chronic respiratory disease; that in comparison with control subjects, GR from CF serum behaves differently after storage; and that serum GR from CF and carriers behaves differently from control GR in the presence of heparin.", "75142": "Hodes-M-E.

At lower concentrations a difference was noted occasionally between some normal subjects and some individuals carrying one or two genes for cystic fibrosis. Data from an independent series of experiments indicate that the naupliar deaths result from distorted ratios of Na+/K+ and not from a specific gene product.

We have, therefore, investigated aspects of complex saccharide synthesis and secretion by such cells compared with fibroblasts derived from heterozygous (HZ) parents and from normal (N) children. The main glycosaminoglycans produced by skin fibroblasts during in vitro culture were hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfates, and dermatan sulfate-like materials. Using double-label experiments with D-[3H]- or [14c]glucosamine and analyzing the products by ion exchange chromatography, it was shown for five CF, two HZ, and four N lines that these polysaccharides were secreted into the medium in approximately similar proportions to each other. Moreover, experiments in which three CF, nine HZ, and three N lines were grown in log phase for up to 5 days in the presence of [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine indicate that, during such a period, CF fibroblasts do not secrete complex carbohydrates at rates significantly different from N or HZ cells. Neither do such cells shown an abnormal intracellular accumulation of complex carbohydrates. The latter observation was further confirmed by preparing whole cell autoradiographs during growth of six CF, two HZ, and three N lines in the presence of D-[3H]glucosamine and, subsequently, after addition of unlabeled medium.", "75147": "McEvoy-F-A.

There was no significant difference between the polyamine concentrations of blood samples from CF patients and control subjects. Also, the spermidine-spermine ratio was similar in both groups. Polyamines were also analyzed in exocrine fluids, and although none could be detected in either CF or control sweat or saliva, significant amounts of spermine and spermidine were present in all samples of bile and duodenal fluids. It thus seems likely that the biliary route is a significant pathway in the human for excretion of polyamines. The observation that polyamines are excreted in considerable concentrations via the bile in children may be of interest in view of the reports of elevated urinary polyamine concentrations in neoplastic states. Since measurable amounts of spermine and spermidine were detected in all six bile preparations available for this study, analysis of these substances in bile may be of benefit in particular cases.", "75148": "Shwachman-H.

The diagnosis of CF in each patient was delayed because they did not have pancreatic insufficiency. The diagnosis of CF was documented by the typical pulmonary involvement and elevated sweat sodium and chloride levels in all cases and a positive family history in six of the ten patients. Two patients were diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis before the diagnosis of CF was made, thus indicating that acute pancreatitis may be the presenting complaint in the young adult with CF. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was based on the presence of severe abdominal pain, usually with vomiting, tenderness in the mid- epigastrium, elevated serum and urinary amylase and serum lipase. Attacks were precipitated by fatty meals, alcohol ingestion; postcholecystectomy and tetracycline administration. In some patients no precipitating event could be elicited. Intravenous secretin- pancreozymin stimulation tests revealed a diminished bicarbonate secretion with little effect on the secretion of the zymogen enzymes. A mild attack of pancreatitis occurred after secretin-pancreozymin stimulation. The endocrine pancreatic function tested in four patients was normal as revealed by the glucose tolerance tests and determinations of serum insulin, growth hormone and free fatty acid. Transduodenal pancreatograms were performed in three patients; one showed a normal pancreatic duct, one showed duct obstruction and in the third patient a beady type of narrowing was found. The selenomethionine Se 75 uptake of the pancreas was noted only in the head of the pancreas. This suggests that loss of function occurs initially to a greater extent in the tail and body of the pancreas.

This is true of both hemophilia and cystic fibrosis. Despite their success in keeping slightly more than two thirds of their patients out of the hospital, I think that they might be more successful in the future if the following points are considered. First, many of those initially selected for intravenous medications due to their nonresponsiveness to oral therapy and again later considered failures of intravenous treatment might actually be noncompliers. My second point concerns the lack of follow-up within the patient's home. It would seem to me that this would be an ideal place for a public health nurse to check on the patient's condition, ensure that the procedure was being properly followed under actual field conditions, and that the correct amount of medicine has been utilized. - Dr. David's letter regarding potential problems of noncompliance and home follow-up in the use of outpatient intravenous antibiotics points out the need for this type of therapy to be instituted only in those centers in which these facets can be well controlled.

During an intravenous insulin test, the decrease in blood glucose concentration was the same for both groups, in spite of significantly lower serum insulin levels in the patients with cystic fibrosis .The percentage fall in plasma free fatty acids was at least as great in the patients with cystic fibrosis as in normals during the test procedures; while a significant decrease in plasma alpha-amino nitrogen after intravenously administered insulin was seen only in the patients with cystic fibrosis.

The time of occurrence of the peak serum concentration was similar in both groups and the total urinary recovery of dicloxacillin was normal or increased in the CF patients, suggesting that the intestinal absorption of the drug was unaffected by the disease. The low serum concentrations in the CF patients were caused by unusually high renal clearances of dicloxacillin which average 282 +/- 135 compared to 95 +/- 28 ml/min/1.73 sq m in the normal subjects. Creatinine clearances were also elevated in the CF patients by 55% on average, while urea clearances were normal. The serum protein binding of dicloxacillin was similar in both groups of subjects.

These results stand in contrast to those of Henkin and Powell, who found children with cystic fibrosis to be hypersensitive to both olfactory and taste stimuli. Apparent hypersensitivity to taste stimuli could have resulted from the adapting effects of the relatively high level of sodium in the saliva of children with cystic fibrosis. If the contaminating effects of saliva are removed, children with cystic fibrosis yield, on the average, a taste threshold identical to that of normal children. There appears to be no simple explanation for why Henkin and Powell found hypersensitivity to odorants. The present results indicate that, in fact, children with cystic fibrosis display a slight hyposensitivity to odorants.", "75159": "Holzel-A.The quest for the basic defect in cystic fibrosis.Physiotherapy. 1975 Aug 10. 61(8).

There is no doubt that it is a disease recessively inherited, ie that the parents carry the cystic fibrosis gene without showing any signs of ill health (heterozygous) but when transmitted from both of them to an offspring this child manifests the disease, having acquired the abnormal gene in double dose (homozygote). Cystic fibrosis is the most common of the genetically determined diseases. Two types of cultured cells, fibroblasts and white cells from affected individuals and heterozygous carriers for cystic fibrosis, showed characteristic changes of metachromasia that seemed to allow for a classification of patients and carriers to be distributed into separate classes. Serum from patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas disorganises the movement of cilia of the isolated rabbit tracheal mucosa. One of the early and also most constant observations is the 'viscosity' of secretions of the mucosal glands in the respiratory tract, in the alimentary apparatus, in the biliary system and in the pancreas. A striking increase in the levels of sodium and chloride, and to a lesser extent of potassium, is present in the sweat of practically all sufferers of cystic fibrosis. However frustrating and tantalising the outcome of research into the basic defect has been so far, the ultimate answer is likely to be astonishing in it simplicity.", "75160": "Mearns-M-B.Inhalation therapy in cystic fibrosis.Physiotherapy. 1975 Aug 10. 61(8).

The present state of knowledge of the basic defect of cystic fibrosis makes it impossible to give hard and fast guide lines for the use of inhalation therapy. Much depends on the individual experience of the physician and the degree of pulmonary involvement of the individual patient. Response to bronchodilators can be assessed relatively easily, assessment of mucolytics and antibiotics is difficult. Antibiotics can be useful in helping to clear infection in those patients with early disease, as judged by clearing of pathogens from the cough swab or sputum. In patients with chronic cough and large volumes if purulent sputum with positive culture from gram negative bacteria, the cultures never become negative and only in the occasional patient can definite clinical benefit be claimed. A few severely ill patients have dramatically improved when this therapy has been introduced, and the patients are convinced of the benefit of this treatment. It is of course impossible in this disease, with such a varying clinical course, to prove scientifically that the inhalation therapy was the reason for this improvement.", "75161": "Gaskell-D.Physiotherapy for adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis.Physiotherapy. 1975 Aug 10. 61(8).

About 1 in 10 babies with cystic fibrosis are born with acute intestinal obstruction due to plugging of the small intestine with very sticky meconium. Diagnosis is made by the test for excess salt in the sweat, and although possible very soon after birth, it is easier to carry out at about three weeks of age when the baby sweats more freely. The great majority of children, if not treated, tend to suffer progressively more frequent chest infections or chronic chest infections. The reason for the tendency of the lungs of children with cystic fibrosis to become colonised by harmful bacteria is not known. Most cystic fibrosis children absorb carbohydrate normally, but only about 50% (range 45% to 80%) of the protein and fats they eat. The only other major problem for which any active measures may be required is the occurrence of fibrosis of the liver in about 5% of these children.

From the moment of diagnosis, delayed or not, the parents' problems multiply and for the most part these problems are at first only vaguely comprehended. Many parents embark on the long haul of caring for their child in almost total ignorance of the disease and its implications. The fact that the disease is inherited is of outstanding importance to the parents. The basis of genetic counseling in the disease is the explanation of recessive inheritance. Even when genetic counseling has been given effectively and the parents have decided to have no further children, the family planning problem is not yet solved. The physiotherapist is also necessarily concerned with the emotional state and behaviour of the child. Except in the latest stages of this disease the child's emotional distress is not directly related to the discomfort of his symptoms. Over-protection by parents is understandable but it is important to persuade them that it is undesirable. Perhaps the most difficult questions of protection arise in relation to the child's knowledge of his own disorder.

CELIAC-DISEASE: et.Cystic Fibrosis (fibrocystic disease of the pancreas) is a common inherited disease which, to date, still has a fatal outcome. The diversity of clinical manifestations and pathological findings has added further to the mysterious nature of the disease, as have the tantalizingly conflicting results of biochemical, physical and experimental studies in many laboratories of the western world. One of the most constant clinical observations is the viscosity of the secretion of the mucosal glands in the respiratory and alimentary tracts, in the ducts of the biliary system and in the pancreas. In approximately 10 to 15 per cent of all patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas the earliest manifestation, meconium ileus, occurs in the neonatal period. In the remaining 85 to 90 per cent of affected infants the symptoms generally become evident within the course of the first year of life. The lung symptoms tend to dominate the clinical picture in the vast majority of untreated patients and will ultimately decide the outcome. The lower respiratory tract is not the only part involved: nasal polyps and the accumulation of viscous secretions in the paranasal sinuses with subsequent bacterial infection are not unusual. Pancreatic deficiency is present in the vast majority of patients with cystic fibrosis and consists of a gross reduction or complete absence of exocrine secretion. Although some histological damage has been seen in the neonatal period in infants suffering from meconium ileus, in general the full-blown picture of extensive cirrhosis, with portal hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, and severe and sometimes fatal haemorrhages from oesophageal varices, is seen in the older child and adolescent. Screening of the newborn to enable the institution of protective measures before lung complications arise has been attempted with various techniques. Management includes diet and pancreatic enzyme replacement. The treatment of pulmonary disease is the most important aspect of care in patients with cystic fibrosis, and its prevention is priority number one in the over-all management. The outlook for the child born with cystic fibrosis depends to a large extent upon the avoidance, or delay until adult life, of the two complications that threaten his existence: cor pulmonale and cirrhosis of the liver.", "75168": "Chamberlain-J.Screening for the early detection of diseases in Great Britain.Prev-Med. 1975 Sep. 4(3).

Evidence from research in screening for a number of diseases is very briefly summarized, and it is concluded that there may be some development of programmes for the early detection and treatment of hypertension and of breast cancer, but for other diseases and for multiphasic screening, evidence so far available is insufficient to warrant any immediate extension from research towards service.", "75169": "Siwinska-Golebiowska-H.Studies on immunoglobulins in healthy children in various stages of development and in the chosen illnesses.Probl-Med-Wieku-Rozwoj. 1975. 4.

The results suggested that the population of CF patients could be divided into two groups in spite of an absence of difference in clinical status between the groups. Average concentrations of seven plasma proteins in sputum of group I CF patients were identical with those in sputum of patients with bronchitis, but the average concentrations of six of these proteins in sputum from group II CF patients were higher than those in specimens from the bronchitic patients and were similar to corresponding concentrations in sputum from patients with asthma, all of whom were examined while in status asthmaticus. The average concentrations of 14 secretory proteins were the same in all sputum specimens whether or not they were produced by patients with cystic fibrosis, asthma or bronchitis. It was concluded that the concentrations in the bronchopulmonary secretions of proteins associated with host defence were not diminished in patients with cystic fibrosis, and failure to produce adequate concentrations of proteins with antimicrobial activity was unlikely to be responsible for the above average susceptibility to chest infection in cystic fibrosis.

The presence and degree of RVH were measured by Fulton's technique of weighing the ventricles separately. Of the subjects who died after the age of 3 years, one in six had no RVH, although the mean age of this group was not significantly different from that of the remainder. There was no correlation between duration of cyanosis, haemoglobin levels, and RVH. Although not statistically significant, the cases without RVH tended to have had clubbing of the finger-nails for longer periods before death. The electrocardiogram was useful in the diagnosis of RVH. Right ventricular hypertrophy was common in children with lungs of large volume as judged by the radiographic centile of lung length. Cases with RVH show reduced background haze in the arteriogram and fewer arteries per unit area of lung. For the first time thickening of the medial muscle layer proportional to the degree of RVH has been demonstrated, only in the smaller arteries. Arterial subintimal fibrosis is more common in cases with RVH, as is thickening of the walls of small pulmonary veins. The implications of these findings are discussed.", "75183": "Gocmen-A.The comparison of peak flow rate with other spirometric measurements in cyctic fibrosis patients.Turk-J-Pediatr. 1975 Jul-Aug. 17(3-4).

Moreover, the efficacy of therapy has been difficult to evaluate for several reasons: the lack of a suitable animal model for therapeutic experimentation, the protean manifestations of the disease, the natural variations in its severity, the prolonged periods of observation that are required by its very chronicity and frequently the lack of satisfactory clinical parameters by which to score response. Stated in its simplest form, the treatment of cystic fibrosis is directed towards the long-term control of salt loss, malabsorption and bronchial obstruction, the management of several complications of the disease and the establishment of a positive therapeutic environment that minimizes anxiety and depression. The purpose of this review are to help the pediatric practitioner gain security in his day-to-day management of children with the disease and to advocate an effective working relationship between the practitioner and a regional cystic fibrosis or pediatric pulmonary center for long-term patient management. Problems in diagnosis, treatment of salt loss, the prevention and treatment of malabsorption, the prevention and treatment of bronchial obstruction, the prevention and treatment of certain complications, and the psychosocial support of the patient and family are discussed.", "76005": "Nadler-H-L.Prenatal detection of genetic defects.Adv-Pediatr. 1976. 22.

The major emphasis in this chapter will be a detailed review of the newer approaches toward antenatal detection of congenital malformations and hemoglobinopathies as well as an overview of the experience and problems of antenatal detection for chromosomal aberrations and inborn errors of metabolism. Approaches to prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders include amniocentesis, visualization of the fetus, and fetal blood sampling. Prenatal detection of genetic disorders has become a reality. The area is evolving so rapidly that the major indications for intrauterine diagnosis have substantially changed within the past year. Prior to this time, maternal age, previous Down's syndrome, inborn errors of metabolism and X-linked recessive disorders were the primary criteria, with approximately 85% of the cases being used for cytogenetic analysis. Within the past year, in a number of laboratories, about half of the referrals for amniocentesis have been for central nervous system defects. Certainly with the development of technics for fetal blood sampling, this distribution of the frequencies of indication may, once again, change substantially. Most probably for the next few years cytogenetic abnormalities and neural tube defects will be the most common indications for amniocentesis. Amniocentesis will continue to be offered to many patients with inborn errors of metabolism and probably will be available for monitoring of hemoglobinopathies and other disorders of fetal blood as well as for accurate knowledge of the health of the fetus.", "76006": "Hawkins-E.

SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-P-H-S.Prior genetic studies of the human pancreatic amylase (Amy2) locus have been directed principally to the electrophoretic analysis of serum and urine, on the assumption that these fluids receive negligible contributions from the salivary (Amy 1) locus. In support of that assumption was the observation that the isozyme bands were lacking in patients with cystic fibrosis and in a postpancreatectomy patient. We have examined the sera of 97 patients having cystic fibrosis and find normal levels of serum amylase. On electrophoresis, three-quarters of the cystic fibrosis patients have a pattern (F- pattern) not observed in normal sera. The pattern is characterized by the absence of Pa 1. Comparative electrophoresis and mixing experiments indicate that the F-pattern is of salivary origin and is unmasked in cystic fibrosis by the absence of a pancreatic contribution. The normal serum pattern is considered to be an admixture of salivary and pancreatic amylase. On the assumption that duodenal fluids might more closely reflect the pancreatic (Amy 2) locus, electrophoretic studies were performed on 148 normal individuals and 37 individuals with cystic fibrosis. Electrophoretic phenotypes in duodenal aspirates are more complex than previously reported in studies of urine and serum; presumably because of the higher concentrations of amylase in the aspirates. Comparative electrophoresis and mixing experiments indicate that the phenotypes observed in duodenal aspirates also reflect admixture of pancreatic and salivary amylase. This recognition of pancreatic and salivary admixture in sera fortunately does not alter our prior understanding of the genetics of the Amy 2 polymorphism. The extensive studies which led to the delineation of the Amy 2 polymorphism were essentially based on the presence or absence of a variant band which proves now to be outside the zone of admixture.", "76013": "Neuburger-N.

PEAK-EXPIRATORY-FLOW-RATE.Transit time analysis of the forced expiratory vital capacity maneuver was applied to 37 patients with cystic fibrosis 8 to 22 years of age. This analysis divides the vital capacity into segments of air and assigns a transit time to each segment. The characteristics of the distribution of these transit times are used as measurements of pulmonary function. The quantities were compared with the forced vital capacity, 1-sec forced expiratory volume, ratio of 1-sec forced expiratory volume to vital capacity, peak flow, forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital capacity, maximal expiratory flow at 25 per cent of the vital capacity, specific airway conductance, and arterial PO2 of these patients. The standard deviation of the transit times was the most frequently abnormal. The mean transit time had the largest range of values in terms of its own standard deviation, and it was the best single estimate of over-all lung function because it correlated almost equally with large and small airway function.

SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-P-H-S.Cystic fibrosis is the most frequent lethal genetic syndrome among white children and is the cause of much of the chronic progressive pulmonary disease encountered in children. Because of the increasing adolescent and adult population of patients with cystic fibrosis and their psychosocial, employment, and treatment needs, this review, whenever possible, will emphasize aspects pertinent to older patients. No known biochemical or structural defect will account for all the pathophysiologic phenomena of cystic fibrosis. Thus, the definition of the disease rests on the clinical findings; cystic fibrosis is a syndrome, and not yet a disease. Incidence figures for cystic fibrosis are necessarily minimal. The best diagnostic efforts currently available fail to detect all those who die at a young age or who have mild symptoms. Several pieces of evidence indicate that cystic fibrosis is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. An autosomal recessive inheritance for cystic fibrosis suggests a discrete biochemical or structural defect. To date no single lesion has been proved to provide a unifying hypothesis for the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis. Exocrine gland dysfunction, mucociliary transport, immunology, ciliary factors and transport mechanisms are discussed. The manifestations of cystic fibrosis involve many organ systems and the pattern of presentation is variable. Respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and sweat gland manifestations are discussed. There are at least 3 possible approaches to screening for cystic fibrosis: sweat testing, evaluation of pancreatic function, or detection of some product of the defective gene. Prenatal diagnosis and heterozygote testing, diagnosis in adults, and diagnostic problems are also examined. Treatment includes prevention, pulmonary therapy, and gastrointestinal therapy.

Four lysosomal hydrolases involved in the breakdown of the carbohydrate side chain were assayed using artificial substrates. The fifth enzyme, aspartylglucosamine amido hydrolase, which cleaves the linkage between this side chain and the peptide backbone, was assayed with natural substrate. No differences in enzyme activities between the 2 leukocyte sources were observed. Because no enzyme activities were deficient and no compensatory increases were noted, we concluded that the thick, glycoprotein-rich, exocrine secretions in cystic fibrosis cannot be attributed to a defect in their catabolism.", "76017": "Corey-M.

Knowledge of the effects of age and the effects of diseases, which are often unique to each stage of postnatal development, upon drug action and disposition is a vital and necessary prerequisite to a discussion of interactions of drugs of abuse in the pediatric population. It is essential that the developmental status of the host be taken into consideration when examining interactions of drugs in infants and children. The mechanisms of interactions are similar to those seen in the adult patient. The developmental status of the pediatric patient also plays a significant role in the manifestations of disease seen in sick infants and children.

SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-P-H-S.Submandibular secretions collected from children with cystic fibrosis (CF) showed increased protein concentrations (milligrams/milliliter) and increased amylase specific activity (units/milligram of protein) relative to normals secretions. These differences between normal (N) and CF secretions were as follows: protein, 1.25 plus or minus 0.51 (N), 1.75 plus or minus 0.35 (CF) (P < 0.02); and amylase, 58 plus or minus 18 (N), 80 plus or minus 19 (CF) (P < 0.001). To determine the basis for elevated protein in CF saliva, several major proteins resolved by polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis were quantitated by densitometry. These included four phosphoproteins (PP), serum albumin, an acid phosphatase-containing fraction, amylase, and an unidentified protein referred to as PI-7.1. Together, these proteins comprise greater than 75% of the total protein in the secretion. Differences in individual protein concentrations (milligrams/milliliter) resolved from normal and CF secretions, respectively, were as follows: PP2, 0.02 plus or minus 0.01, 0.03 plus or minus 0.02 (NS, not significant); PP3, 0.06 plus or minus 0.04, 0.05 plus or minus 0.03 (NS); acid phosphatase fraction, 0.06 plus or minus 0.04, 0.12 plus or minus 0.07 (P < 0.05); amylase, 0.09 plus or minus 0.04, 0.27 plus or minus 0.16 (P < 0.01); and pI-7.1, 0.04 plus or minus 0.02, 0.13 plus or minus 0.08 (P < 0.02). Amylase, the most significant contributor to the elevated protein, comprised 26% of the total protein of normal secretions and 38% of the total protein of CF secretions. Thus, our results do not support the concept of a generalized increase in all organic components in CF submandibular secretions but, rather, increases in specific proteins, namely amylase, component pI-7.1, and an acid phosphatase-containing fraction.", "76021": "Hochman-H-I.

They express their disappointment at not finding any difference between the life expectancy of children presenting during the first year and that of all cases. In fact the former may be a little worse. Is it not what should be expected? Since infection is known to be present as early as the first month of life, the diagnosis is probably late in nearly all cases. Do the authors not point out the necessity of an evaluation of neonatal screening? On the other hand, and logically, one can expect that a very late diagnosis is consistent nowadays with a very mild case - and the best therapeutic results! Shwachman's report of patients over 17 years of age seems to support this belief: only 12% of the series had been diagnosed before one year of age. Therefore I think we should evaluate the course of late presenting cases (after one year of age for instance) separately since a large delay in diagnosis may be a clue to the mildness of the disease.", "76023": "Griffiths-A-D.

PREDNISOLONE: pd.We agree with the comment of Dr Feighery and Mr Woods that a low migration index signifies sensitivity to an antigen which can be achieved only by functionally active immunocompetent cells. However, we must emphasise that the functions of active immunocompetent cells may or may not be impaired, depending upon the antigens to which such cells are sensitised. Since comparative cells from age-matched controls and from blood donors did not show such sensitisation to those antigens to which the cystic fibrosis cells were sensitised then there is no doubt that the normal function of these immunocompetent cells in the patients with CF is indeed impaired. When one considers that steroids are known immunosuppressants it is certainly not surprising that treatment of the CF patients with prednisolone caused a decreased sensitivity of these sensitised CF cells to the antigens. Indeed, therapeutic concentrations of steroids were able to reduce the ability of sensitised spleen cells and of lymph-node cells to destroy target cells in vitro. Apart from this inhibition of sensitised cells by steroids, 90% of sensitised lymphocytes were killed when prednisolone 1 mg/l was present during the sensitisation phase. In addition it was observed in man that if cortisol or prednisolone was given two hours before abrading the skin, then there occurred a marked reduction of emigrations of both mononuclear cells and polymorphs into the area, thus inhibiting the mobilisation of macrophages. We believe that the situation with regard to steroid therapy and inhibition of migration of leukocytes from CF patients is similar.", "76043": "Cooperman-E-M.Cystic fibrosis: physiology gone wrong.Can-Med-Assoc-J. 1976 Jun 19. 114(12).

At the light and electron microscopic levels, significant acinar cell atrophy and degranulation were observed. Cellular necrosis, and increases in quantity of lysosome-like dense bodies, mast cells, and macrophages were also detected. These changes are suggestive of tissue response to injurious foreign protein. Furthermore, the fact that normal sera pronounced the same kind of effects (but greatly reduced in extent) strengthens the view that these effects result from the immunologic response of the host organ to foreign antigen.

In addition, the clinical and radiological status of the lungs were evaluated, using two scoring systems. Eleven of 16 serum proteins differed from the values of a thousand-donor serum pool. The most pronounced differences from the control sera were elevated acute-phase proteins, notably haptoglobin, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, IgG, and IgA, and low serum albumin and alpha2-HS-glycoprotein. Patients from metachromatic class III presented the most pronounced rise in acute-phase proteins and, furthermore, significantly decreased complement C3 and IgM, IgG and IgA were normal in class III patients. These differences from the control sera possibly reflect inflammatory tissue damage involving immune reactions. The clinical score was positively correlated to the radiologic score, and both these scores were positively correlated to the concentrations of eight and seven, respectively, of the serum proteins, and negatively correlated to three of the serum proteins. Based upon the correlations between the scores and the concentrations of some of the serum proteins, it is recommended that longitudinal prospective studies follow individual patients for the concentrations in serum of haptoglobin, albumin, IgA, IgG, C3, and, eventually, IgM and alpha1-antichymotrypsin.

In ketoacidotic diabetics, it required at least a month for high Hb AI levels (16.9 +/- 2.6 per cent) to stabilize at nonacidotic levels (12.8 +/- 0.3 per cent), suggesting that decreases occur only as new red cells form under conditions less favorable to Hb AI synthesis. Abnormal amounts os Hb A and Hb AI resisted removal from diabetic red-cell membranes by low ionic buffers but yielded to hypotonic Tris buffer.

Although cholestasis is defined physiologically, it can be considered to have morphological features. Morphological cholestasis is the presence of bile pigments in histopathological sections of the liver and is most easily recognized as bile plugs or thrombi in bile canaliculi. Physiological cholestasis, a reduction in bile flow, is inferred from the finding of an elevated serum bile acid. This inference is derived from the known positive correlation between canalicular bile flow and bile acid excretion that has been found to occur in all species this far examined, including man. An increase in the amount of bile acid in plasma implies a reduction in the hepatic transport of the primary conjugated bile acids of man and therefore a decrease in associated canalicular bile flow.

There was a good correlation between the degree of bile acid (BA) and fat sequestration. Concomitant changes in bile acid and fat loss were observed in the one group of six patients studied on and off pancreatic enzymes as well as in a second group of seven children treated with pancreatic supplements and maintained on a normal diet followed by a low fat diet supplemented with medium chain triglycerides.

Qualitative bile acid patterns in controls, in infants after an ileal resection, and in patients with CF or with coeliac disease showed that the percentage of primary BA followed closely the total amount excreted except in situations where antibiotics were administered. The exact mechanism for the increased loss of BA in CF is unknown. It is found in all age groups and is related to the presence and degree of pancreatic insufficiency.

Although bronchitis, mucopurulent plugging, and bronchopneumonia were almost universally present among children of all ages, epithelial metaplasia and bronchiectasis were rarer among infants and progressively more prevalent in older age groups. Emphysema was absent in patients under two years of age and affected 11 per cent of the patients two to six years of age and 40 per cent of the patients older than six years, but was never of a severe degree by the point count method. Pulmonary hemorrhage, although uncommon, was usually associated with prominent arterial vessels in walls of bronchiectatic airways. Quantitative assessment of bronchial glands revealed Reid indices significantly higher in patients with cystic fibrosis when compared to noncystic fibrosis patients, but there was no increase in these indices with the age of the patients. Glandular hypertrophy, predominance of mucous acini within glands, and goblet cell hyperplasia of the bronchial mucosa all suggest an explanation for the copious mucous secretion of patients with cystic fibrosis. However, it was not possible to ascertain whether these findings reflect a general exocrine defect of such patients or whether they were merely a response to chronic airway infection, even though the latter is a more plausible assumption.", "76076": "Benke-P-J.Biochemistry of cystic fibrosis: an overview. pp. 157-64.In: Mangos JA, Talamo RC, ed.

One amino acid is not found in elevated concentrations in the urine, one abnormal sugar or polysaccharide is not found in secretions of the bronchial tree which causes pulmonary damage, and a unique material which inhibits sodium transport has not yet been identified in sweat. Instead of viewing the current state of CF research as chaotic, perhaps we should say in a positive way that the diversity of ideas stimulates thinking, and in the process of sorting out the primary defect, a wide spectrum of pathophysiologic changes will be recognized. Recently a positive-charged polypeptide associated with immunoglobulin G has been identified which may be responsible for the ciliary dyskinesis effect of CF serum. This material should demonstrate the same properties when bound to immunoglobulin G from control sera. It would be interesting if it were identical with the basic protein recently found only in the serum and IgG fraction of CF patients and carriers. Further work may identify how the polypeptide affects cell membrane surfaces, and whether a defective peptidase, perhaps an arginine esterase, fails to break down the polypeptide.

Those problem areas which complicate our understanding of this disease include methods of diagnosis, ascertainment, and analysis and interpretation of data. In spite of an apparently clear-cut mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive), several conceptual difficulties exist in the acceptance of this formal transmission pattern. The most pressing problem of all, perhaps, is the population genetics of CF. The fact that a lethal gene may be maintained at such elevated frequencies and restricted to given population groups represents a seemingly genetic paradox. Our aim is to review some of the problems encountered in a genetic study of CF and to propose a theoretical model which may help in their elucidation. Topics discussed include problems of diagnosis, ascertainment, and data analysis; family studies and inferences as to the mode of inheritance; population studies; and a proposed model for the inheritance of CF. The main tenet of this model states that CF is determined by dominant alleles at two autosomal loci, with interaction between them.", "76078": "Talamo-R-C. Stiehm-E-R.

Specific immune mechanisms in the B and T cell systems are examined.

First, patients with the disease secrete more mucus than normal subjects, as indicated by gland hypertrophy, and frequently retain it in the lung. Second, the mucus is said to have altered biochemical and rheological properties; however, although the physiochemical properties of mucus are altered in all lung diseases, little histochemical or rheological difference has been found in mucus from patients with CF and other hypersecretory conditions such as chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis. Third, a factor in the serum of CF patients inhibits normal ciliary activity in explain glands of ciliated epithelium; and infection, which damages human ciliated epithelium in culture, could further reduce mucociliary transport.

This dysfunction results in abnormalities of the composition and/or the physiochemical behavior of the various exocrine gland products. Although significant advances have been made in our understanding of exocrine gland physiology and pharmacology, many questions remain unanswered and significant gaps exist in our knowledge of exocrine gland function. Perhaps clarification of these issues may lead to better understanding of the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis and to development of better forms of therapy for the patients. The purpose of this article is to review past and present developments in this area of biomedical research and to point out areas of exocrine gland physiology and pharmacology where more knowledge is needed in order to clarify the nature of a disease like cystic fibrosis.

In contrast, the more protein-rich or mucoid, isotonic secretions (viz, from the pancreas and tracheobronchial mucus glands) are found to have sodium concentrations near normal or even somewhat decreased. However, these secretions have significantly reduced water content. The abnormalities in hypotonic secretions appear to rise from a decreased Na+ reabsorption in the ducts. The low water content of the isotonic secretions of CF patients appears to result from decreased secretion of water and electrolytes. Early studies on tracheobronchial secretions from CF patients led investigators to suggest that the primary defect may be a decrease in the levels of water and monovalent ions. In an attempt to provide a unifying hypothesis, it has been suggested that an increased calcium concentration in the various exocrine secretions leads to a \"hyperpermeability\" of the mucus linings and thus to an excessive loss of water and small ions. The concentration of calcium in exocrine secretions appears to follow the concentration of proteins and especially the mucous glycoproteins. It was suggested that calcium may be an important factor in the increased viscosity and insolubility of CF mucus. Organic ions are also potential perturbants of macromolecular structure. In addition to a possible perturbant role, polyamines have a potential role in water and electrolyte transport.", "76088": "Lederberg-S.Polypeptide mediators of cystic fibrosis. pp. 259-71.In: Mangos JA, Talamo RC, ed.

SALIVA: me.Although complex models involving multiple loci may be plausible, the high frequency of cystic fibrosis in Caucasians is probably best explained by selective advantage for the heterozygote carrier. In short, an analogy of cystic fibrosis with hemoglobin S sickle cell anemia may be greater than with Tay-Sachs disease in terms of molecular mechanisms. Protein and polypeptide differences have been reported for the humoral fluids of cystic fibrosis patients and their heterozygotic relatives in connected with selected bioassay systems. These directions relate to a model here proposed for the intermediate stages of the physiology of cystic fibrosis, which builds on a large body of elegant experimental work. The basic tenet is that the cells of cystic fibrosis heterozygotes and normal individuals are in a stimulatory loop. Chronic reserpine treatment exaggerates in the normal rat a loop similar to the one exaggerated by genetic differences in the human, elevating to pathological levels an otherwise normal process.", "76089": "Barbero-G-J.

The difference between levels of trypsin-like activity of mixed saliva of patients with cystic fibrosis and controls has been confirmed. A number of studies have been carried out in order to determine if a deficiency of proteolytic activity might account for the presence of cystic fibrosis serum factors. It was presumed that the observed partial deficiency of arginine esterase activity might well represent the total deficiency of one of several arginine esterases assayed under the experimental conditions. Although it was postulated that the deficiency of arginine esterase activity is related to the elevation of the levels of polypeptide or protein \"factors\", the hydrolysis of peptide bands by activated plasma could not be demonstrated, probably due to the limitations of the methods employed.

Fluorescein- conjugated, monovalent antiserum specific to heavy chains of human immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, or IgM and to complement C3 were used. All strains of P. aeruginosa recovered from the sputum specimens of patients with cystic fibrosis were found to be coated with antibodies of IgA, IgG, and IgM classes and with C3. The specificity of the antibody coating was determined. The fluorescence was most intense with IgA and was followed in intensity by IgG, IgM, and C3. No difference was noted between rough and mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa. When the subcultured P. aeruginosa was incubated with the sputum eluates, a similar pattern of fluorescence was demonstrated, indicating that these humoral factors are present in the sputum and that the coating process can take place in the lower respiratory tract of the patients. By single radial immunodiffusion, significant quantities of the humoral factors in the sputum eluates were detected.

Does the antibiotic treatment in cystic fibrosis differ from the treatment of respiratory infection in other conditions? The cystic fibrosis patient not only suffers progressive deterioration in respiratory function; he often has dangerous complicating conditions culminating in super-infection by highly resistant organisms. The basic principle of antibiotic therapy must be rigidly applied in cystic fibrosis. The first principle is to identify the pathogen and its susceptibility to antibiotics. The second principle is to ensure that the chosen antibiotic reaches the site of infection. The third principle is that the antibiotic therapy ought to complement the immunological defences of the patient. A fourth principle is that no therapy must be given without first deciding upon the criteria which will be acceptable as indicating clinical improvement.", "76099": "Barranco-S-C. Bolton-W-E.

Obligate heterozygotes incorporated an intermediate amount of the DNA precursor. Studied were initiated to determine the basis of the differential incorporation of 3HTdR among the genotypes. An analog of thymidine, BUdR, produced varied effects on the growth kinetics of the three genotypes. The growth of cells in BUdR resulted in a 50% increase in the population doubling times of all three genotypes, and caused the cell morphology to change from a spindle shape to one in which the cells became broadened and flat, with numerous cytoplasmic projections extending for distances of several cell diameters. The activities of thymidine kinase and the participation of the exogenous and de novo pathways in the synthesis of TMP were found to be approximately the same in all three genotypes. The data suggest that an alteration in the transport of thymidine into the cells may account for the differences in TdR incorporation into DNA, and this may be associated with other changes in cystic fibrosis that are apparently membrane associated.", "76100": "Tannenbaum-P-J.

TRACHEA: pa, ul.The effects of serum from children with cystic fibrosis and from normal children on the mucus-secreting, ciliated epithelium have been investigated in vitro using explanted tissue from rabbit lung. By optical and scanning electron microscopy, a sequence of structural changes is observed after incubation with cystic fibrosis serum; this sequence does not occur with normal serum. The earliest changes involve swelling of the goblet cells, with subsequent discharge of mucus onto the epithelial surface. This is followed by disruption of the normally rapid and synchronized ciliary activity. Mucus gradually extends over the surface entangling cilia. Finally, some shedding of ciliated cells occurs from the epithelium. These findings suggest that factors in cystic fibrosis serum cause discharge of mucus leading to a disturbance of the normal ciliary activity in the rabbit lung. It is postulated that such changes result in dysfunction of the mucociliary clearance mechanism and that this dysfunction may be a contributory factor to the pathogenesis of lung disease.", "76128": "Antonowicz-I.

We have reduced the number of false positives by additional studies on the meconium, including detection of lactase. Lactase activity can be detected in meconium from babies with C.F. but not in meconium for healthy babies. In testing 200 normal meconiums with a negative albumin test we noted 3 positive tests for lactase. These 3 patients did not have C.F. These false-positive lactase tests could be distinguished by the addition of distilled water to the meconium instead of lactose.

This is not to say that the meconium test is valueless.

CELL-MEMBRANE-PERMEABILITY: de. CILIA: ph. HUMAN. RABBITS. TISSUE-CULTURE. TRACHEA: pa.In an effort to determine whether increased permeability to calcium ions could explain the cystic fibrosis-serum ciliary dyskensia factor response in the tracheal test system, we selectively increased the membrane permeability of the tracheal epithelium to calcium ions by adding calcium ionophore A23187 to the tracheal culture medium. These studies determined that calcium ionophore A23187 in culture medium produced a change in mucociliary function in the tracheal test system indistinguishable from that promoted by C.F. sera. These investigations, which are now being extended to include the ultrastructural alterations induced in the epithelium of the rabbit tracheal bioassay system, point to an important role for calcium as a cofactor in the production of the C.D.F. response generated by the C.F sera. The C.F. serum substance seems to act at the cellular-membrane level, promoting membrane-permeability changes (at least with respect to calcium) in the rabbit tracheal test system. Such a mechanism would not necessarily result in a net physiological imbalance of calcium in the rabbit tracheal system but only local changes in calcium concentration that would subsequently alter secretion and microtubular function. Since C.F. serum, like sweat and saliva from these same patients, can promote ionic fluxes, perhaps there is a common factor in all these body-fluids which is related to the basic defect in C.F. It is tempting to speculate that such a factor produces a membrane-associated phenomenon that may be generally representative of the in-vivo C.F. disorder and as such may reflect the nature of the cellular and glandular abnormalities of the disease.", "76131": "McFarlane-H.

Two other observations merit mention. First, the demonstration by Magos of the existence of a factor in CF sweat which interfered with reabsorption of sodium in the rat parotid. Secondly is the existence of a CF serum component which interfered with ciliary rhythm in organ culture systems. Our investigations in cystic fibrosis have been oriented towards the establishment of a possible pedigree of causes which will unite all these observations and secondly to develop a possible method for heterozygote detection. Cystic fibrosis RNA is relatively undermethylated in comparison with contrast cultures. In addition, CF heterozygote fibroblast cultures also appear undermethylated. Our interpretation of these data do not imply a primary defect of RNA methylases in cystic fibrosis but rather suggested a defect elsewhere in biochemical sequences involving methionine.

If bronchial mucins are the main glycoproteins in the fibrillar mucus, these data suggest that there is a high proportion of acidic mucins within the bronchial secretions from CF patients.

The possible in vivo role of ciliary dysfunction in the pathogenesis of the disease is of particular clinical interest. Since an in vitro ciliary dyskinesia factor had been previously demonstrated and pulmonary complications are the hallmark of CF, yet clearance in most of our clinically stable CF subjects was relatively well maintained, this suggested to us that a mucociliary transport abnormality might be present intermittently. In order to explore this further, we designed nasal mucociliary clearance studies to determine whether CF serum might exhibit MCT inhibition in vivo. From these studies, we concluded that there was a substance(s) in CF serum which had the capacity to slow MCT. Whether this effect is on the cilia themselves or via overproduction of normal or abnormal mucus is not known.", "76148": "Aspin-N. Wong-J-W. Yeates-D-B.

In this laboratory, we have developed a relatively noninvasive technique for measuring mucociliary tracheal transport rates. We measured MTTRs in 20 patients with cystic fibrosis. The MTTRs did not correlate well with the degree of pulmonary disease in these patients. The measurements of MTTR would suggest that a deranged mucociliary clearance mechanism is not a necessary condition for patients with CF.

Although not fulfilling the hopes of a quick route to discovery of the basic defect in this disease that were raised by the first findings, the study of fibroblasts in cystic fibrosis has given important information. The evidence at present indicates that lysosomes and probably other intracellular organelles are normal in morphology and function in cystic fibrosis. Several humoral abnormalities have been found in cystic fibrosis: those that influence ciliary activity in experimental models; those that affect membrane transport; and the abnormality in polyamine distribution. A number of abnormal humoral factors have been found in cystic fibrosis. The limitations in their interpretation are serious: the assays used to delineate these abnormalities are often not universally reproducible, some because of their inherent variability and others because they are technically forbidding.

Miscellaneous observations regarding salivary and tear glands, calcium, the kallikrein-kinin system, protease inhibitor, alpha-fetoprotein, and endocrine glands are discussed. Because more than 90 per cent of patients with cystic fibrosis die of progressive pulmonary involvement, complicated by infection with Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (or both), the question of immunologic deficit is frequently raised. Extensive investigations have shown the immune system in cystic fibrosis to be intact. Studies regarding pulmonary ciliary clearance and bacteriology are also outlined. Despite extensive investigations, the basic defect of cystic fibrosis is still unknown. What then is the explanation of the two defects in homozygotes that lead to most clinical manifestations - the sweat electrolyte defect and the abnormality in physiochemical behavior of mucous secretions? The former is satisfactorily explained by a sodium-reabsorption-inhibitory factor present in sweat and saliva of patients. As for the mucous-secretion abnormality, the effect of the increasing calcium concentration in decreasing the solubility of glycoproteins suggests that this mechanism might be responsible for the precipitation and obstruction of organ passages, which gives rise to most symptoms in cystic fibrosis.

Furthermore, administration of iodides to children with cystic fibrosis resulted in goiter decrease in serum thyroxine and increase in serum thyrotropin concentration. Our studies point to multiple derangement in thyroid hormone economy in children with cystic fibrosis. Peripheral deiodination of thyroxine to tri-iodothyronine may be defective, probably as a result of a state of malnutrition. An intrinsic abnormality may also be present in the thyroid gland. Iodide, which is frequently used in this disease, may enhance this defect, occasionally producing hypothyroidism. Therefore, the thyroid, like other organs of endodermal origin (lung and pancreas), may be involved in cystic fibrosis. Thyroid function should be examined in all children with cystic fibrosis, and if iodides are administered, replacement doses of thyroid hormones should also be given to prevent hypothyroidism. - A recent review of cystic fibrosis referred to the report by Chandra et al. that the serum level of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is increased in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or heterozygotes who bear the CF gene. The report of Chandra et al. had prompted us to assess the level of AFP in cystic fibrosis, and we wish to record here briefly our negative observations. On the whole, these results suggest that AFP is not increased in cystic fibrosis. - We thought that the complications of therapy with iodides or other agents was beyond the scope of our review, and thus we did not discuss the very interesting observations of the high rate of goiter after iodide therapy in CF patients.

The preliminary work already undertaken indicates that modern methods applied to this secretion may provide information that is different from that obtained in other body fluids. Saliva is collected at the point of its manufacture and, therefore, is unaffected by collection or storage in the body. It is the product both of protein synthesis within the glands and of most of the known water and electrolyte exchange mechanisms. Salivary composition is affected by both autonomic and hormonal stimuli. As the specific influence of each of these factors is better understood, studies of this fluid will provide important clues to the understanding of disease and the evaluation of therapy. There are few places in the body where it is possible directly, utilizing a non-invasive technique, to examine the product of a large number of important biological processes. It is obvious that careful handling of collection and analytic techniques are essential if these secretions are to be utilized.

REVIEW.The Golgi complex has an important role in the regulation and normal development of the cell, contributing to anabolic functions including the assembly and secretion of macromolecules and to catabolic functions, in the synthesis of lysosomes. The central role of the Golgi complex in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins has been demonstrated. The purpose of this review is to focus attention on the structural and functional correlation of the Golgi complex in the liver, in relation to its involvement in disease. The hepatic parenchymal cell has been used widely as a model to study biosynthetic, absorptive and secretory functions of epithelial cell types.

The onset of an infectious disease in these patients can be sudden or insidious with few prodromal signs. Anorexia, malaise, fever, and vomiting are nonspecific symptoms that these children may manifest because of their primary illness or its treatment. Any insult to natural defense barriers may cause serious infections in the compromised host. An infected wound from an insect bite, easily controlled by local measures in a healthy person, may become a focus for septicemia in a child with leukemia. Despite the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the specific infection, the immunosuppressed person is still subject to overwhelming infection by resistant opportunistic organisms until the natural defense mechanisms are restored.

To evaluate the usefulness of echocardiographic measurement of right ventricular dimension and septal motion in assessing cor pulmonale, we studied 94 patients with cystic fibrosis of varying severity. There was a significant relationship between increasing right ventricular dimension index (RVDI) and (1) decreasing clinical score, vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and maximal midexpiratory flow rate (MMFR); and (2) increasing residual volume and thoracic gas volume. There was no correlation between right ventricular dimension index and PaO2. These findings were supported by electrocardiogram and pathologic evidence of right ventricular involvement. Abnormal septal motion was observed more frequently in patients with severe obstructive airway disease as measured by decreased vital capacity, FEV1, and MMFR.

Drops of turbid saliva, from samples incubated for 2 hr at 2 degrees or 37 degrees, additionally contained discrete, electron-dense crystals having well defined angular morphology: usually cubic, retangular, or approximately hexagonal.

A transition from the hexagonal to the rectangular pattern and back to the hexagonal pattern could be obtained from individual crystals tilted in the electron microscope. The square diffraction pattern may be from octa-calcium or brushite. Polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis of the parotid saliva indicated that the sparingly soluble proteins in the 2 degree and 37 degree pellets comprised proline-rich proteins and a calcium-precipitable, trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable phosphoprotein, which fluoresced with amido schwarz and Coomassie brilliant blue G250.", "76167": "Shapira-E.

In this study, the pooled plasma from control individuals was activated and partially purified after adsorption on columns of soybean trypsin inhibitor conjugated to Sepharose 4B followed by elution with benzamidine. The fraction was further purified by isoelectrofocusing on polyacrylamide gels. Proteins around the pI range of 5.5 were eluted and utilized to prepare an antiserum. Immunoelectrophoresis of activated plasma samples from control subjects and patients with cystic fibrosis was performed utilizing the antiserum. In controls, four precipitin arcs with residual esterase activity were observed, whereas only three were seen in plasma from patients with cystic fibrosis.

The concentration of acini, islets, main ducts, lobular ducts, connective tissue, and fat was compared with control levels. The results show that in the least involved pancreases, from neonates who died under 5 months of age, acini were reduced to 33% of control levels and the following were increased: islets, to 410%, lobular ducts, to 250%; and main ducts, to 1700% of controls. With increasing severity of the pancreatic disease the acini were further reduced to 5% and lobular ducts to 37% of control levels, respectively. Main ducts increased by 19-fold, and fatty infiltration accounted for more than 25% of the fresh weight of the pancreas in 9 of the 16 specimens. Comparative biochemical studies of 35 fibrocystic pancreases were quantitatively related to the severity of the pancreatic involvement as follows. Water and volatile matter, normally accounting for 80 +/-% of the weight of the fresh pancreas, was reduced to less than 30% in the most affected organs. The concentration of zinc diminished from near normal mean levels of 193 mugZn/g dry pancreas to 10% of this amount in the severely involved pancreas. Elevated concentrations of calcium, amounting to over 10 times control level, were found in obstructed ductal structures. Calcium was depleted from pancreatic sections adjacent to the obstructions. The following biochemical indicators were significantly different in their mean levels in the 35 fibrocystic pancreases when compared with the 17 controls: (P less than or equal to 0.001) fat, water, zinc, calcium, copper, magnesium, potassium, and sodium (P less than or equal to 0.01).", "76169": "Gahl-W-A.

At 37 degrees, a slowly forming, stable turbidity appeared in increased amounts in parotid saliva samples containing increased amounts of calcium. The 2 degree centrifuged pellet consisted predominantly of protein, whereas the 37 degree pellet contained calcium, inorganic phosphate, and protein. The cold- dependent turbidity at 2 degrees was not inhibited by EDTA, but 37 degrees turbidity was dramatically inhibited. Urea and guanidine hydrochloride reduced 2 degree turbidity, and, to a lesser extent, inhibited 37 degree turbidity. The tendency towards higher levels of protein, amylase, and calcium in CF compared with child control parotid saliva (4, 6) causes a greater incidence and degree of turbidity formation in saliva of CF patients.

TRYPSIN: bl.A protein with an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.48 was found to be deficient in plasma from most cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes and obligate heterozygote carriers of CF as compared with normal control plasma. Purification of the protein with a pI of 5.48 from normal plasma was performed using ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE- cellulose and CM-cellulose chromatography, Sephadex G-200- gel filtration, starch block electrophoresis, and Sepharose 4B gel filtration. The purified protein migrated as a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and displayed a single arc on immunoelectrophoresis against polyvalent antiserum to whole human serum. Results from various techniques used in its characterization indicate that this protein is a fragment of alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M) which is derived from alpha2M by proteolytic cleavage of intact alpha2M subunits. Quantitation of alpha2M levels in plasma indicated no significant differences between levels of alpha2M in CF homozygote, obligate heterozygote carrier, or normal control plasma samples. Quantitation of arginine esterase activity in plasma treated with cloroform and ellagic acid indicated that both the total arginine esterase activity and that fraction of arginine esterase activity inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) were decreased in most CF homozygote and obligate heterozygote plasma samples relative to normal control values. The results of this study indicate that plasma samples from CF homozygotes and obligate heterozygote carriers for CF show deficient proteolytic cleavage of alpha2M as compared with normal control plasma, and suggest that a structural abnormality in alpha2M or a deficiency in plasma proteolytic activity may be responsible for this deficiency in proteolysis.", "76177": "Cheung-A-T.

Careful analyses of the high speed cinemicrographs reveal that cystic fibrosis serum has no effect on the rhythm and beat pattern of rabbit tracheal cilia.

Our rationale for selecting this system for CF factor analysis relates to the tight and essential mechanochemical coupling of functioning cilia. Using rabbit tracheal epithelium as the source, a high molecular weight (greater than 200,000) ATPase was identified, partially purified, and extensively characterized. The properties of this protein were similar to those observed in previous studies of others with flagellar and ciliary dynein (the motility-associated ATPase) isolated from microorganisms. Analysis of the pH profile revealed a broad range of high enzymatic activity between 6.5 and 9. Studies with potential cation activators showed that the enzyme is activated equally by either Ca2+ or Mg2+ in equimolar concentrations. No activation occurred in the presence of Zn2+, Na+, H+, or Na+ plus K+ and the effect of Mg2+ or Ca2+ was not inhibited by Na+, K+, or Na+ plus K+. The enzyme hydrolyzed Mg2+- containing solutions of UTP, CTP, and ADP at 51-54% the rate of ATP dephosphorylation, whereas Mg-deoxy-ATP was hydrolyzed 79% as effectively as ATP. Using a newly devised, analytical technique with [gamma-32P]ATP as the substrate, the ATP hydrolysis of various ciliary preparations from rabbit trachea and oyster gill (including motile suspensions) was monitored in the presence of sera from CF homo- and heterozygotes. Reproducible rates of ATP dephosphorylation averaging 27 nmol/min/mg protein were demonstrable with homogenates of ciliated epithelium. None of the test systems evaluated, however, were capable of demonstrating CF-related differences in ATPase activity or ATP utilization.

Some mucous secretions also show an elevation in calcium concentration. Using purified rat intestinal goblet cell mucin as a model mucin, we have investigated the effect of millimolar additions (1-25 mM) of CaCl2 on the physical properties of the mucin. Isotonicity of incubation media was preserved in order to mimic in vivo conditions. CaCl2 (8-15mM) caused a 15-33% decrease in viscosity, no change in electrophoretic mobility in acrylamide gels, and a 20-30% decrease in solubility of the mucin. Solubility changes were reversed by the addition of EDTA (20 mM) to incubations. Insolubility was also produced in incubations of mucin with a mixture of soluble intestinal contents (NaCl washings). These findings strongly suggest that the mucin became smaller and more dense as calcium was added, a process most probably achieved by loss of intramolecular water.", "76180": "Wilson-G-B. Arnaud-P.

Since another carbohydrase, mammalian debranching enzyme, is much more sensitive to inhibition, the effect of the isolated crude factor on this enzyme was determined. The mean values for percentage of inhibition of debranching enzyme activity by fractions obtained from saliva of CF patients, obligate heterozygotes, and control subjects are: 32% (27 samples), 13% (21 samples), and 6% (11 samples), respectively. Fifteen of the CF values exceed the maximum 13% inhibition observed for controls. Indeed, five samples almost completely inhibited debranching enzyme. This inhibitory action provides the basis of an enzymatic assay for the detection of the ciliostatic CF factor.", "76182": "Thompson-F-E. Quissell-D-O. Williams-C-H.

PALMITATES: me.Impaired oxygen supply and deteriorating health, in cystic fibrosis patients, correlates with abnormal changes in the fatty acid composition of blood lipids. As the proportion of oleates increases and that of linoleates decreases, erythrocyte membrane interference with the formation of intracellular oxyhemoglobin increases and arterial oxygen pressure decreases. The physical-chemical basis for these changes seems to be that oleic and linoleic acid differ in their ability to undergo reversible oxygenation in response to changes in oxygen pressure. The oxygen complex of linoleic acid dissociates at relatively high pressures, whereas that of oleic dissociates only at low pressures. Accordingly, excessive substitution of oleic for linoleic acid in membrane lipids would be expected to decrease the intracellular oxygen pressure to a level where hemoglobin oxygenation and any other oxygen-requiring processes would be impaired.", "76186": "Elliott-R-B.A therapeutic trial of fatty acid supplementation in cystic fibrosis.Pediatrics. 1976 Apr. 57(4).

I would suggest that the deleterious effects seen by Dietzsch et al. are due to their inattention to experimental detail and lack of communication with other investigators. - Dietzsch et al. give the impression in their article that all arginine solution are detrimental to the lung. We wish to point out that L-arginine hydrochloride buffered with a sodium solution is irritative to the airway of cystic fibrosis patients. However, no comparison studies were done with L-arginine buffered with free base. - The fate of these children with cystic fibrosis depends on the quality of the inhalation treatment. This means if you replace a good mucolytic drug with a better one you step by step approach the ideal mucolytic solution. We think it to be unethical to use other, less effective, drugs or solutions in a control group (e.g., saline or distilled water). We did not state that arginine solutions are \"irritative\" or that arginine treatment is \"dangerous.\" The N-acetylcysteine solution, which was successfully used before the treatment of our patients, was buffered with sodium hydroxide to a pH of 7.0. The quantity of sodium which was administered during each inhalation amounts to only 0.04 mval of sodium so that an injurious pharmacological effect can be excluded.

The difference between the strains was observed at every stage of the culture cycle and was specific to stimulation by beta-adrenergic agonists. It could not be accounted for by different dose- or time- response curves nor by leakage of cyclic AMP into the medium.

The role of the respiratory therapist in the care of such patients is unique. This is due to the extensiveness of patient contact, both verbal and physical, and to the primary threat that pulmonary disease poses to the patient with CF. The therapist's ability to cope with the problem, while aiding the family and patient to do the same, becomes crucial to the child's rehabilitation.

All samples were also screened by electrofocusing for cystic fibrosis protein (CFP), a metabolic marker previously shown to be associated with the CF gene. Significantly increased levels of CEA activity were found in all CFP-positive groups; however, with one exception all patient controls with marked increases in CEA activity were CFP- negative. Immunodiffusion of perchloric acid extracts of CEA-like material from heterozygote carrier blood indicated that the CEA-like material, which was elevated in homozygotes and heterozygotes for CF, showed only partial identity with two separate CEA preparations obtained from colon carcinomas and was not identical to either A, B, or O(H) blood group substances. This glycoprotein material did, however, react with three different anti-CEA antisera. Our finding of an abnormally increased glycoprotein in cystic fibrosis, taken together with previous reports demonstrating abnormalities in the carbohydrate portion of glycoproteins found in various exocrine secretions in CF, further suggests that the primary defect in this disease is manifested partly as a defect in glycoprotein metabolism.

For parents of children with cystic fibrosis, the divorce rate is the same as the national average. The high recurrence risk for cystic fibrosis may deter many parents from further reproduction.

P 1525.CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: fg.CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di. HUMAN.Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive autosomal genetic disease in which exocrine glands secrete highly viscous mucus. Variable genetic penetrance (\"organ sparing\") results in a broad spectrum of clinical presentations. The diagnosis of CF is usually established by the presence of chronic obstructive lung disease and/or gastrointestinal dysfunction, together with elevated levels of sweat electrolytes (chloride > 60 mEq/liter), markedly diminished duodenal pancreatic enzyme concentrations, or pathologic changes in tissue. Family history may occasionally be helpful. The metabolic basis of CF is unknown. The classic stereotype of the CF patient is an infant with a chronic cough, diarrhea, and growth failure. Improved medical care is enabling many of these patients to reach adulthood, and increased diagnostic suspicion is resulting in identification of the disease in more adults. Based upon analysis of over 11,000 cases of CF reported during the year 1974 by 119 Cystic Fibrosis Centers, the National Cystic Fibrosis Foundation estimated that the probability of an individual with CF surviving to age 20 was approximately 39%. Although most of these adults are currently under the care of pediatricians, the development of medical, psychiatric, surgical, or obstetric complications may necessitate the involvement of other professionals. A joint study of cystic fibrosis in adults conducted by Duke Medical Center and the NIH has shown that the majority of affected adults, including those diagnosed early in life, are married and work full- or part-time. Many manifest few if any symptoms until relatively late in life. Since this study was retrospective, the reported frequencies of the clinical findings tend to underestimate, in all instances, the actual incidence in the population studied.

SPERMIDINE: pd.The effect of plasma or serum from homozygotes and heterozygotes for the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene on the active uptake of 3-0-14C-methyl- D-glucose (3-0-14C-MDG) by rat jejunal epithelium was studied. Furthermore, the role of the polyamine, spermidine, and its products of metabolic degradation on glucose transport were investigated, and a relationship to the pathogenesis of membrane dysfunction in cystic fibrosis was postulated. Glucose transport in everted rat jejunal rings was used in the study. Results were expressed as 3-0-14C-MDG concentration ratio between the intracellular (ICF) and the extracellular fluid spaces (ECF) of the jejunal rings at the end of a 60 min incubation period. The mean ratio obtained from incubations of the rat jejunal rings in medium consisting of Krebs-Ringer- bicarbonate buffer and the labeled sugar was considered as 100% uptake. When plasma or serum, with or without spermidine, was mixed with the medium in a volume ratio of 1:3, a decrease in the active uptake of 3-0-14C-MDG was observed, expressed as percent inhibition. Percent inhibition of 3-0-14C-MDG uptake obtained when the rat jejunal rings were incubated in normal plasma was compared to that obtained with plasma from cystic fibrosis genotypes. It was found that: 1) plasma from 25 homozygous children had greater inhibitory effect on glucose uptake than plasma from 26 normal children; 2) plasma from 9 heterozygous women had greater inhibitory effect than that from 6 normal women; 3) the inhibitory effect of plasma from 3 homozygous children was not influenced by dialysis; 4) the inhibitory effects of paired plasma and serum samples from 9 homozygotes were comparable; 5) spermidine added to the incubating electrolyte solution did not affect glucose transport; 6) the addition of spermidine to reaction mixtures containing normal plasma potentiated the inhibitory effect; and 7) mixing and incubation of fresh bovine serum with reaction mixtures containing plasma from homozygotes decreased the inhibitory effect. The predominant inhibitory effect of plasma or serum from homozygotes and heterozygotes for the CF gene appears to be related to a nondialyzeable molecule(s). It does not seem to reflect the presence of high plasma glucose levels in cystic fibrosis nor to be the result of competitive inhibition between sugars. It does not seem to be the result of sodium or other electrolyte differences. A similar inhibitory effect is acquired by normal plasma after the addition of spermidine. On the other hand, plasma from CF homozygotes loses its inhibitory effect after incubation with fresh bovine serum. These findings may indicate that products of metabolic degradation of spermidine are responsible for the inhibitory effect of glucose transport and suggest the possibility of a role in abnormal polyamine metabolism in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.", "76211": "Baur-P-S.

In 4 of the experiments examined topologically (SEM), the CF sera (either heterozygous or homozygous) stimulated the production of mucus that was found in close association with the cilia. The association of excessive mucus with the cell surface could be responsible, in part, for the well-known inhibition of ciliary activity by a factor in CF serum. In 3 additional SEM experiments involving shorter treatment times, very little difference could be observed between homozygous CF, heterozygous CF, and normal serum-fraction-treated oyster tissues. In parallel experiments, ultrathin sections of gill tissue were examined by means of TEM. Those samples that were responsive, as determined by TEM, displayed several characteristic features, including enlarged and partially exuded goblet cells, altered mucus structure along with twisted and matted cilia.

Characterization and comparison of fractions containing the CFCI were carried out by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis confirmed previous molecular weight estimations of 4,500 to 11,000 for the CFCI and provided an estimate of the number of proteins present in the fractions. Low molecular weight proteins from serum and media were combined with IgG preparations. No specific binding to IgG by the media fraction containing the CFCI could be demonstrated by the techniques employed. There was decreased binding of the low molecular weight serum fraction containing CFCI to native IgG molecules from cystic fibrosis patients as compared to IgG from normal individuals. However, IgG from CF individuals demonstrated increased binding of the cfci- containing low molecular weight serum fraction after gel filtration in the presence of guanidinium chloride. This suggests: 1) that very low concentrations of CFCI are present in media fractions; and 2) that native CF IgG cannot bind the low molecular weight CFCI fractions to the same degree as native IgG from normals or CF IgG that has been dissociated from non-covalently bound components.", "76213": "Danes-B-S.Expression of the cystic fibrosis genotype in cultured somatic cells.Tex-Rep-Biol-Med. 1976. 34(1).

In addition, information demonstrating a correlation between a biochemical abnormality and disease severity was observed.

In addition, we also find CDF in fibroblast media from these same donors and in amniotic fluid cell media derived from CF carrier or affected fetuses. In these latter instances, the media were inactive in the bioassay, but became active when mixed with purified IgG. In all instances, CDF activity was eliminated by the addition of anti-IgG. We have separated a low molecular weight fraction, between 1,000 and 10,000 M.W., from CF sera and culture media which is inactive in the bioassay until IgG is added. Presumptive and indirect evidence indicates that this fraction behaves similarly to the complement derived anaphylatoxin C3a. In addition, we have found activity in sera from CF patients and, to a lesser extent, carriers that induces degranulation of cytochalasin-B- treated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Since this activity appears to be in a different molecular species from that containing CDF, we postulate that the primary defect in CF is the deficiency of an enzyme whose substrates include a family of membrane-active molecules.", "76220": "Wilson-G-B.

Results of analyzing sera from selected CF patients by isoelectric focusing indicated that there is a general correlation between the amount of the gamma CF factor and the clinical severity of the disease.

Alkaline paranitrophenylphosphatase activity was divided between the cell surface and interior.

Adenosine monophosphatase activities of 2 control and 2 cystic fibrosis strains fluctuated similarly during the cell culture cycle. The apparent Km values relative to adenosine monophosphate were similar in all strains.

Results showed that it was possible to detect precipitating antibody in the sputum, and the rate was increased when both methods were used. A discrepancy was noted between the detection rate in the sputum and serum. This, combined with the lack of correlation between sputum and serum immunoglobulins, lack of relationship between bronchial inflammation and sputum immunoglobulins, and the lack of IgM in the sputum suggested that the antibody and immunoglobulin were locally produced. Sputum IgA (7S) in patients with chronic bronchitis was significantly lower (P less than 0-05) than that found in patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Significant differences (P less than 0- 05) were also noted in serum IgG levels between patients with chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis while serum IgM levels in patients with chronic bronchitis were significantly lower (P less than 0-05) when compared to serum levels in patients with cystic fibrosis.

In addition to the higher total amylase activity, in MV homozygote patients P/S is less than 0.1, and even 0.001. The phenomenon is explained by a compensatory enhancement of salivary activity.

The hypersecretion of mucus, even in the absence of pus in the sputum or of other signs of infection, is of itself associated with significantly poor lung function. Infection is probably the important stimulus in cystic fibrosis. Certain anti-inflammatory agents are now known to cause retention of mucus within the secretory cells although the rate of synthesis is not raised. It may be that this offers a new way of control.

Besides his physical symptoms, the child with a chronic illness must endure prolonged hospitalization, psychological stresses, decreased activity, and is often denied opportunity for skill practice and peer group activities.

REVIEW.Cumulative survival in cystic fibrosis (CF) for three successive 5-year periods between 1952 and 1967 is 35%, 64%, and 77%, respectively. Operative mortality in meconium ileus is not reduced to 25% from 70%. N-Acetylcysteine effectively cleanses the bowel of tenacious meconium plugs when directly injected during laparotomy. However, Mucomist enema alone generally does not suffice. Selected cases have been treated successfully with hyperosmolar Gastrograffin enema. Several screening tests, based on the increased albumin concentrations present in the meconium, are available for CF. The Boehringer-Mannheim test strip is favored, and yielded no false positives in 69,000 tests of meconium. However, 4 of 60 neonates who subsequently proved to have CF had false negative tests. A pathognomonic elevation of sodium and chloride concentrations in the sweat collected by pilocarpine iontophoresis remains the definitive diagnostic test. Bile acid malabsorption occurs in CF but not in celiac disease. The authors postulate that the presence of maldigested materials or the absence of pancreatic enzymes interferes with bile acid absorption. The defect disappears with pancreatic extracts. Substitution of medium-chain triglycerides for dietary long-chain fatty acids reduces steatorrhea in CF. However, the positive effect of MCT on weight gain is transitory.

The information available at present strongly suggests that mucociliary transport, at least in central airways, is impaired in most patients with cystic fibrosis; however, it is still unclear whether this disorder is a nonspecific feature of the chronic inflammatory airway disease or represents an essential factor in the pathogenesis of the pulmonary abnormalities.", "77024": "Keens-T-G.

TIME-FACTORS.Ventilatory muscles can become fatigued, and this can contribute to respiratory failure. Patients with chronic obstructive lung disease may benefit from improving their ventilatory muscle endurance to improve resistance to fatigue. Ventilatory muscle endurance was measured in 30 normal subjects and 55 patients with cystic fibrosis by finding the highest level of normocapnic hyperpnea that could be sustained for 15 min. Subjects with cystic fibrosis had 36 per cent higher ventilatory muscle endurance than normal subjects, reflecting the chronic training stress of breathing against increased respiratory loads. Four normal subjects and 4 subjects with cystic fibrosis participated in a specific ventilatory muscle endurance training program consisting of 25 min per day of maximal normocapnic hyperpnea 5 days per week for 4 weeks. The cystic fibrosis patients who trained improved their ventilatory muscle endurance by 51.6 per cent, whereas the normal subjects who trained showed a 22.1 per cent increase in ventilatory muscle endurance. Seven subjects with cystic fibrosis participated in a 4-week physical activity training program consisting of at least 1.5 hours per day of intensive swimming and canoeing at summer camp. They increased their ventilatory muscle endurance by 56.7 per cent. There were no other pulmonary function changes.

Chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis are similar in a number of respects. The treatment of cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis has some similarities. But chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis also differ in many respects. The pathogenesis of chronic bronchitis is more clearly related to exogonous factors such as smoking and air pollution than is cystic fibrosis, which is genetically determined. Clinical differences also exist. Major differences in treatment between cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis are currently in vogue. Because of the special problems of adulthood, it is appropriate that many adult patients with cystic fibrosis be cared for by internists who have previously focused their attention on chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Increased communication between internists and pediatricians on the issue of cystic fibrosis is badly needed today.", "77026": "Lieberman-J.

The abnormal response of the lymphocytes from persons with cystic fibrosis was due to a serum factor and not to any intrinsic abnormality of the lymphocytes. An abnormal response to hytohemagglutinin occurred in only 14 per cent of 44 healthy control subjects, but in 100 per cent of 14 adults homozygous for cystic fibrosis and in 85 per cent of 26 adults presumed to be heterozygous for cystic fibrosis. As a result of this phenomenon, lymphocytic beta-glucuronidase concentrations were significantly lower than normal in patients with cystic fibrosis when the cells were cultured with phytohemagglutinin and autologous serum.

STATISTICS.Increased fertility of heterozygotes with respect to decreased foetal loss among offspring of heterozygotes has been proposed by several authors as a possible explanation for the high gene frequency of CF, TSD and PKU in certain populations. Studies comparing reproductive outcome of heterozygotes with reproductive performance in the general population or in special control groups have been done on several occasions. These studies, however, are known to be heavily biased, on the one side by the fact that ascertainment of heterozygotes through affected offspinrg will tend to underestimate the relative frequency of smaller families, and on the other side because of the inadequacy of census data for comparison and the biases inherent in selection of control families. Careful analysis of the biases involved provides suggestions for proper corrections.

TIME-FACTORS.The sweat test, even if carried out by an experienced technician, sometimes lacks reproducibility owing presumably to physiological variations (patient's diet, temperature, and other factors at present unrecognized). Some patients are particularly prone to exhibit this variability and in them a single sweat test is almost valueless. The aldosterone status is believed to be responsible for a reciprocal relationship between sweat sodium and potassium concentrations: tests done on 8 patients show that a high sweat potassium is associated with a correspondingly lower sodium--a circumstance which must be borne in mind when interpreting a patient's sweat sodium. Of 30 patients presenting with a variety of symptoms compatible with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and with sweat sodium ranging from 50 to 75 mEq/1 (50-75 mmol/1), only 4 have proved to have cystic fibrosis after several years of observations; 13 have later been diagnosed as having asthma. The problem of the 'grey area' of uncertainty is aggravated by the heterozygous state which is also associated with a sweat sodium in this range. Repeated sweat tests are indicated if the sweat sodium lies within the 'grey area', and the diagnostic importance accorded the test should diminish as the sodium value approaches this area.

SELECTION-GENETICS.When a genic disorder is only manifest if there are offending alleles at both loci, as in fibrocystic disease, there is a loss of two abnormal alleles with each affected birth since the homozygotes rarely reproduce. How is this loss compensated? How could some 50,000 alleles, which can only survive to convey themselves in effective gametes if they have a normal allelic partner, become established in the British Isles - and how have some half a million or more got into the world currency? First, migrations and settlements involve the proportion of defective alleles at all loci being conserved, but their variety being increased. Secondly, there could be a general tendency due to some advantage in health or vitality, which could be manifest by disease resistance, cold resistance, and by any number of physical or psychological mechanisms. Thirdly, there may be 'compensation' - that is the death of an infant may lead to replacement as a result of which the replacing sib, if surviving, would have a 2/3 chance of being a carrier. Fourthly, the disease may be maintained by mutation. Of the four possibilities, three are unrealistic, so that substantial selective advantage of heterozygotes over the last few hundred years must be postulated.", "77036": "Lipson-A.

SKIN: en.Nine lysomal enzymes and alkaline phosphatase have been assayed with two different ultramicro techniques in the intra- and extracellular space of fibroblast cultures derived from the skin of cystic fibrosis patients, cystic fibrosis carriers, and normals controls, respectively. Evidence has been obtained for a multiple leakage of lysomal enzymes and of alkaline phosphatase into the medium of fibroblast cultures from cystic fibrosis patients and carriers. The situation is comparable to a certain extent, to that observed in I-cell-disease (mucolipidosis II). This multiple leakage results in the decrease of intracellular activity of several lysosomal enzymes in cultures from cystic fibrosis patients and carriers and due to the coordinate regulationof the synthesis of the \"leaky enzymes\" in an overshooting of the intracellular alkaline phosphatase activity in cultures from cystic fibrosis patients. It also explains the retarded catabolism of certain molecules, such as the Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein, in cystic fibrosis cells. It is speculated that the basic defect in cystic fibrosis leads to abnormal recognition sites on lysosomal enzymes and on alkaline phosphatase, and in consequence to the leakage of those enzymes into the extracellular space.

Two patients did not undergo the procedure and served as control subjects. All patients were characterized as having varying severity of pulmonary involvement. Large central airways were severely obstructed, and older patients had more trapped gas in their lungs. Hypoxemia and large alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure differences [P(A-a)O2] were due to inhomogeneity of alveolar ventilation. Results indicated that up to ten days to two weeks, bronchoscopic bronchial washing may in some instances improve maximal expiratory flow-volume curves and specific airway conductance and decrease P(A-a)O2 towards normal.

PCA reactions to a number of allergens could be detected in both the C.F. sputum and saliva. Several of the C.F. heterozygotes had a strongly positive history of allergy and a significant number of these heterozygotes had an elevated serum total IgE as well as positive PCA to Timothy grass pollen or to D. pteronyssinus similar to the patients with asthma or hay fever.

SKIN-TESTS.Cystic fibrosis (CF) children had a greater variability of skin prick test response compared with asthmatic children, when the tests were performed on two occasions. This suggests that there is a different cause for the allergy in the two groups, perhaps because the asthmatics have a transient period of susceptibility to sensitization in infancy and the CF children a persistent vulnerability. Amongst the asthmatic children, clinical improvement was associated with loss of some skin prick test reactions, and clinical deterioration with an increase in the number of positive reactions. Thus continuing allergic reactions may maintain a mucosal defect, resulting in a persistence of susceptibility to allergen sensitization, and control of the reactions may re-establish normal mucosal defence mechanisms.", "77051": "Guha-A-K.

An inhibitor protein (from wheat) with a 100-fold greater specificity for human salivary than for human pancreatic amylase was used to analyze mixtures of the two enzymes. The concentration of pancreatic and salivary amyalase was determined in 141 normal sera (72 men and 69 women). Statistically significant differences were found for serum pancreatic amylase between mean and women, higher values being shown in women. No sex-related difference was found for the salivary component of serum amylase. With this method, the increase in serum amylase activity in pancreatitis was shown to be attributable to the pancreatic component. In mumps, the increase is attributable to the salivary component. In pancreatic insufficiency, serum pancreatic amylase activities were significantly lower than in the controls.

SYNDROME. TRYPSINOGEN: df.Pancreatic development begins during the fourth week of gestation. In annular pancreas, the ventral pancreas fails to migrate to the right of the duodenum. Duplication of the pancreatic ducts is a rare entity, probably arising from accidental misplacement of mucosal cells from the duodenum or stomach during the development of the pancreatic pouches. Congenital pancreatic cysts may be single, multiple, unilocular or multilocular and can be associated with polycystic disease of the kidney, liver or spleen. Ectopic pancreas occurs before or during the rotation of the ventral pancreas and its fusion with the dorsal pancreas. Few tumours of the pancreas have been reported in children less than 15 years of age. The evaluation of patients via different pancreatic function tests is significant only when the results are interpreted in the light of clinical manifestations. Tests of exocrine pancreatic function in childhood include stool examination, the triolein test, blood examination, analysis of duodenal contents, the secretin-pancreozymin test, pancreatic scanning with selenomethionine, transduodenal pancreatogram, abdominal ultrasound and arteriography, and upper gastrointestinal x-ray. The most prevalent disorder of the pancreas in infancy and childhood is exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Well over 96 per cent of infants and children with pancreatic insufficiency have cystic fibrosis. Shwachman syndrome is the second most common cause of pancreatic insufficiency and is associated with neutropenia, metaphyseal dystosis, sever stunting of growth, eczema, and susceptibility to infections. Patients with cystic fibrosis who have partial pancreatic insufficiency sometimes show dissociation of different enzyme activities.

The typical shortcomings of an assay measuring biological activity have been studied, and the means to overcome the weaknesses of the oyster gill cilia assay have been established. The presence of the cystic fibrosis mucociliary inhibitor (CFMI) in experimental fractions may be determined by accepting data from only those assays in which authentic CF and normal (non-CF) fractions give defined reactions, by measuring the reaction of each sample at least three times, and by examining each experimental sample at a protein concentration greater than the minimum established in this study. The relative concentrations of the CFMI present in the first steps of purification of serum and medium have been calculated in terms of units of inhibition. Generally, the units of inhibition present in serum and medium fractions from heterozygotes are close to one-half of that in fractions from homozygous sources. Analogous fractions concentrated from a normal (non-CF) source never inhibited mucociliary activity, even when tested at nearly 100 times the CF concentration.

These diseases are diabetes, cystic fibrosis, acute and chronic pancreatitis, and carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas. Four of these diseases can be modeled in laboratory animals by acute or chronic administration of chemical poisons or carcinogens. Human pancreatic diseases attributed to the effect of chemical agents including alcohol and drugs include many cases of chronic pancreatitis and some cases of acute pancreatitis. The cause is not known in many cases of human pancreatitis, including interstitial, acute, and chronic clinical forms. Epidemiologic studies suggest that the increasing incidence of carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas in the United States may reflect chemical carcinogenesis. On the basis of experimental observations, we know that pancreatic islet cells can be damaged directly by toxic chemicals, and that islet cell tumors can be chemically induced. Thus, there is adequate background data to conclude that several pancreatic diseases of obscure etiology may be due in part to hitherto unidentified toxic effects of chemical agents encountered in personal or general environments.", "77072": "Brohet-C-R.

Using age-matched normal and CF skin fibroblast strains, we show that (1) at ouabain concentrations < 20x10-9 M binding for both normal and CF cells is linear with time for 1 h and reaches equilibrium after 4 h; (2) at ouabain concentrations between 2 and 20x10-9 M, the initial rate of binding for CF cells is approx. 70% of the normal cells; (3) under equilibrium-binding conditions, Scatchard analysis reveals that three different CF strains have 12, 16, and 44% fewer ouabain-binding sites than their matched normal controls. In addition, studies in potassium-free medium of the inhibition of 86Rb flux (a K-plus analogue) into the cell by ouabain show no differences between CF and normal cells. We have also previously shown that in a low glucose, potassium-deficient medium the CF cells survived ouabain exposure no better than normal cells. In this report, equilibrium-binding studies with [3H]ouabain clearly show that CF cells bind less ouabain under these conditions than normal cells. These results indicate that ouabain resistance in CF cells is not solely a function of differences in ouabain binding. Furthermore, the differential ouabain killing may not be due to ion transport differences, but rather to as yet unknown mechanisms. CF cells thus appear to be unlike previously characterized ouabain-resistant mutants.", "77075": "Lefebvre-D. Ratelle-S. Chartrand-L.

We attempted to confirm this finding by performing [1-14C]cholylglycine breath tests and by measuring fecal bile acid and fat excretion in patients with cystic fibrosis and acquired pancreatic insufficiency. Studies were done when patients were taking pancreatic enzymes (Cotazym) and also without medication. 14CO2 excretion in breath was normal in patients with acquired pancreatic insufficiency and even lower in cystic fibrosis, both with and without Cotazym therapy. Fecal bile acid excretion was slightly elevated in both groups without Cotazym and became normal with Cotazym in patients with acquired pancreatic insufficiency.

These findings are at variance with other studies and deserve comment. In the absence of fecal bile acid values in controls, the authors cannot state that levels in CF are only twice normal values, especially since the papers cited on normal bile acid excretion refer to measurements obtained by a different technique. We also question the validity of the breath test as an index of bile acid malabsorption in CF. Our recent report shows that in 8 older CF (mean age 12.1 years) the magnitude of bile acid loss in the stools was comparable to that of the younger age group (mean age 3.9 years) and that there was no correlation between the age and the degree of bile acid loss. On the other hand, we must take issue with Roller and Kern when they suggest that bile acid malabsorption in CF is probably not clinically important. Our findings not only bear relevance to the intestinal manifestations of CF and to the increased incidence of cholelithiasis but perhaps also to the early deposition within the intrahepatic ducts of eosinophilic mucus concretions proposed as the cause of biliary cirrhosis in this disease.", "77078": "Matsehe-J-W.

KINETICS. SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-P-H-S.Bile acid kinetics was investigated by stable isotope dilution technique in 6 children (ages 3 1/2 months to 4 1/2 years) with previously untreated cystic fibrosis. All of the patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of malabsorption, normal intestinal mucosal function, as judged by glucose absorption, intestinal histology, disaccharidase levels, and normally functioning gallbladders. The children were maintained on a constant diet throughout the study period; fat intake averaged 4.2 g per kg per day. Before administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement, fat excretion equalled 50 plus or minus 4% (mean plus or minus SE) of intake and was reduced to 20 plus or minus 1.0% of intake after therapy. Total bile acid pool size nearly doubled during enzyme replacement from 379 plus or minus 32 micromoles per kg to 620 plus or minus 36 micromoles per kg with secondary bile acids comprising 57% of the total pool before therapy and 40% after therapy. Total bile acid synthesis changed little with therapy, equalling 139 plus or minus 17 micromoles per kg per day (total 602 plus or minus 109 mg per day) without enzyme replacement and 125 plus or minus 19 micromoles per kg per day (total 470 plus or minus 86 milligrams per day) with enzyme replacement. This was confirmed by the fecal excretion of bile acids: 545 plus or minus 166 milligrams of bile acid per day were excreted without enzymes as compared to 513 plus or minus 146 milligrams per day with enzymes. After therapy, the fractional turnover rate of the bile acid pool was reduced from 0.602 plus or minus 0.05 per day to 0.233 plus or minus .03 per day for cholic acidand from 0.696 plus or minus 0.09 per day to 0.39 plus or minus 0.04 per day for chenodeoxycholic acid. These data indicate that both primary and secondary bile acids are conserved within the enterohepatic circulation during enzyme therapy, and that the mechanism for the regulation of hepatic bile acid synthesis is intact in cystic fibrosis. However, the demonstration that large amounts of bile acid continue to be excreted during therapy suggests that interruption of the enterohepatic circulation continues and that deficiencies of the intraluminal phase may persist during enzyme therapy in this disease.", "77080": "Kraemer-R.

SWITZERLAND.The survival rates in 204 patients suffering from cystic fibrosis observed between January 1956 and June 1976 were recorded. The patients were divided into five groups according to the symptoms present at the time of diagnosis and survival rates were recorded separately for each group. Survival was less good in the group of patients presenting initially with pulmonary symptoms compared to the group presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. In the group presenting with meconium ileus survival was poor initially, but later in the course of the disease it became similar to that observed in the other groups. The differences in survival between the different categories occurred during the first two years after diagnosis. The study shows that, on clinical grounds, a severe form of the disease which is characterized by early manifestation of pulmonary symptoms and poor survival can be distinguished from a more protracted form with a better survival. Because of the great inter-individual variability large numbers of patients will have to be evaluated in order to achieve statistically significant results in studies which attempt to compare different therapeutic approaches.

Furthermore, birth replacement in families with CF children (RPE) can account for the estimated historical values of t. Today, however, t is probably at or approaching zero as a result of discontinuation of RPE. In the future we can look for an imperceptibly slow decrease in the incidence of CF.

Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of chronic hypoxemia. There was a high correlation between the weight of individual carotid bodies in each case. Among the 12 patients with chronic hypoxemia, eight patients had carotid bodies heavier than predicted by statistical analysis. Of these eight patients, six had cystic fibrosis and two had cyanotic heart disease. Morphometric and cell population analyses of the carotid bodies from these eight patients and from those of the control population indicated that enlargement of the carotid bodies during normal or abnormal growth results from proportionate increases in lobule parenchyma and stroma. There was also an increase in the width and length of the lobules without an increase in the diameter of the cell cords or a change in the size or proportion of the chief cells. Growth and development of the carotid bodies were studied in a control group of 59 patients without chronic hypoxemia. There were no sex related differences in carotid body weights. The combined weight of the carotid bodies correlated most strongly with body weight, although there was some correlation with age and body length.

Assays of these enzymes under the same conditions in extracts of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, alveolar macrophages, and pig tracheal mucosa indicated that these extracellular airway enzymes were probably not derived from these cell types. Although the above three enzymes were present in secretions of all patients with these three diseases, large amounts of palmitoyl lysolecithin, free fatty acids, and dipalmitoyl lecithin were found only in patients having alveolar proteinosis and asthma. The amount of free fatty acids in these secretions was sufficient to inhibit both the lysolecithinase and the lysolecithin-lysolecithin acyltransferase, but not the phospholipase A2. These findings suggest that the large amount of dipalmitoyl lecithin, free fatty acids, and lysolecithin found in these secretions results from extracellular remodelling by these enzymes. Because the phospholipase A2 was present in large amounts, it was possible after delipidation to purify it to homogeneity.

The patient group had a lowered incidence of plaque and less gingival disease than did the control group in which every person had some amount of plaque or gingival disease. Calculus formation was minimal. The reasons for the finding of minimal plaque in the patient group could be related to several factors, including the life-long use of various antibiotic agents, the chewing of digestive enzyme supplements, the effect of medical management on tooth hardness, and the effect of stained teeth (possible tetracycline deposition) on the plaque microorganisms. It appears that the therapy for cystic fibrosis was beneficial to the periodontal health of these patients. Much further study is needed to understand the interrelationship between an altered oral environment (salivary changes in cystic fibrosis), altered microbial flora (by antibiotics, enzymes) and even altered tooth surfaces (possible tetracycline deposition). Most patients were found to have one or more oral habits. Tooth mobility was associated with tension habits.

Vitamin E status was assessed by measurement of the plasma concentration of the principal circulating isomer, alpha-tocopherol. Results of such determinations in 52 CF patients with pancreatogenic steatorrhea revealed that all were deficient in the vitamin. The extent of decreased plasma tocopherol varied markedly but correlated with indices of intestinal malabsorption, such as the serum carotene concentration and percentage of dietary fat absorbed. Supplementation with 5-10 times the recommended daily allowance of vitamin E in a water-miscible form increased the plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations to normal in all 19 CF patients so evaluated. Studies on the effects of vitamin E deficiency focused on possible hematologic alterations. An improved technique was developed to measure erythrocyte hemolysis in vitro in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. While erythrocyte suspensions from control subjects demonstrated resistance to hemolysis during a 3-h incubation, all samples from tocopherol-deficient CF patients showed abnormal oxidant susceptibility, evidenced by greater than 5% hemoglobin release. The degree of peroxide-induced hemolysis was related to the plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrationin an inverse, sigmoidal manner. The possibility of in vivo hemolysis was assessed by measuring the survival of 51Cr-labeled erythrocytes in 19 vitamin-E deficient patients. A moderate but statistically significant decrease in the mean 51Cr erythrocyte half-life value was found in this group. Measurement of erythrocyte survival before and after supplementation of 6 patients with vitamin E demonstrated that the shortened erythrocyte lifespan could be corrected to normal with this treatment. Other hematologic indices in deficient subjects, however, were normal and did not change upon supplementation with vitamin E. It is concluded that CF is invariably associated with vitamin E deficiency, provided that the patient in question has pancreatic achylia and is not taking supplementary doses of tocopherol. Concomitant hematologic effects consistent with mild hemolysis, but not anemia, occur and may be reversed with vitamin E therapy. Patients with CF should be given daily doses of a water-miscible form of vitamin E to correct the deficiency.", "77096": "Chakravarty-S-C. Bhattacharya-S-N.

Research on disability is an applied science which uses the general tools of scientific method in solving specific problems. Research on disability embraces a wide variety of physical, intellectual, and emotional conditions. The psychological aspects of physical disabilities are especially stressed in the adaptation to lost functions. Examples of research are given from spinal cord injury, end-stage renal disease, facial disfigurement, and cancer of the larynx.", "77121": "Hunt-L-A.

Gel filtration of pronase-digested glycopeptides from both purified virions and infected cell-associated VSV glycoprotein which had been labeled with[3H] glucosamine did not reveal any significant differences in the glycosylation patterns between the different cell cultures. All 4 cell lines were apparently able to synthesize the mannose- and glucosamine- containing core structure and branch chains terminating in sialic acid which are characteristic of asparagine-linked carbohydrate side chains in cellular glycoproteins. Analysis of tryptic glycopeptides by anion-exchange chromotography indicated that the same 2 major sites on the virus polypeptide were recognized and glycosylated in all 4 VSV-infected cell cultures. These studies suggest that the basic biochemical defect(s) in cystic fibrosis is not an absence or deficiency in enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of complex carbohydrate side chains.", "77122": "Luck-S-R.

SCLEROSING-SOLUTIONS: tu.Cystic fibrosis is the most common form of chronic pulmonary disease in the pediatric age group. As these children survive longer with improved therapy, the incidence of pneumothorax has increased. In our patients who were more than 10 years of age, the incidence of pneumothorax was 12.5 percent. We have reviewed the records of 22 patients who have had 44 episodes of pneumothorax complicating cystic fibrosis. In addition, our experience includes one child with histiocytosis in whom pneumothorax was a serious complication. One other pneumothorax occurred in a teen-age girl with apical bullous disease. A child who presents with even a minimal pneumothorax complicating cystic fibrosis is at considerable risk of developing an increasing lung collapse. Even if the pneumothorax resolves, there is a high risk of recurrence. In children treated with only a chest tube there was a 50 percent recurrence. Consequently, we recommend a chest tube for any episode of pneumothorax in a child with cystic fibrosis, with installation of a sclerosing agent when the lung expands. Three of our patients so treated had no recurrence. Children who have a persistent air leak are confined to bed, retain secretions, and pursue a rapid downhill course. A more aggressive approach to these children, consisting of thoracotomy, suture of the air leak, pteural symphysis, and pulmonary lavage is feasible and the mortality rate is low. A pneumothorax in a child with no evidence of cystic fibrosis is a rare event. A persistent air leak is an indication for thoracotomy, suture of the air leak, and lung biopsy. Histiocytosis X is one rare cause for this complication in children.", "77123": "Hassani-M-A.Cystic fibrosis in Iraqi children.J-Trop-Pediatr. 1977 Jun. 23(3).

Seventeen cases of cystic fibrosis were diagnosed at Medical City Teaching College Hospital, University of Baghdad, between 1970 and 1976. In this study the sex-ratio was 2:1.

When the storage iron was within the normal range (+/2+) children with cystic fibrosis absorbed 10-38% (Xa+/-S.D.=21+/-9.3) of the oral 59Fe2+ dose which is identical with the 59Fe-absorption in normal children with normal iron stores (9-45:23+/-8.7%).

The interruption or continuation of pancreatin maintenance therapy and the simultaneous administration of 1-1.5 g pancreatin did not influence 59Fe2+ absorption in cystic fibrosis. There is no evidence for a pancreatic factor required for or inhibiting inorganic and food iron absorption in human beings.

Human rectal goblet and columnar cells transported 3H- glucosamine-labeled secretory products at a substantially slower rate than do comparable colonic cells in smaller mammals. Within any one biopsy sample, the movement of labeled mucus in goblet cells varied widely among cells. Even with individual cells, labeled mucous granules often did not move in concert toward the apical cell surface. Average transport time in the cells of six cystic fibrosis patients and six sibling controls did not differ significantly from those of four adult controls. The carbohydrate composition of glycoprotein secretions of rectal epithelial cells was investigated by comparing autoradiographs of 3H-glucosamine-labeled biopsies with those labeled with 3H-fucose, 3H-N-acetylmannosamine, and 35S- sulfate. The patterns of incorporation of these four precrusors into normal goblet and columnar cells suggested that both cell types may alter the quantity and composition of newly synthesized glycoproteins as they migrate, mature, and senesce. Incorporation patterns in cystic fibrosis biopsies were indistinguishable from those of sibling or adult controls.

TRANSIENTS-AND-MIGRANTS. TROPICAL-CLIMATE.I have found that cystic fibrosis (C.F.), which is very common in South West Africa, occurs almost exclusively in white Afrikaners, probably as a result of inbreeding, the drift from the Northern Cape Colony, and religious and geographical separation. However, I have not found C.F. in the descendants of the Angola Boers, a small proportion (6 - 7%) of the White population who belong to a small branch of the Dutch Reformed Church. The absence of C.F. may stem from their limited numbers (7000) but I suggest that it may have at least partially a genetic basis. Homozygotes with C.F. are subject to salt-losing crises which can be fatal in hot weather and heterozygotes often have an increased concentration of sodium and chlorine ions in their sweat. The influence of environmental temperature and drought may explain why C.F. occurs among Blacks in temperate zones of the United States but not in Africa, and is less frequent in the hot southern regions of Europe than in the colder, more northern areas. Negative selection of this type may have operated only in hot, arid environments and the possibility that other environments offered advantages to C.F. heterozygotes cannot be excluded.", "77133": "Whitelaw-A.

Samples of breast milk were obtained on the sixth and seventh days post partum when the mother was not breast feeding. The two sodium concentrations were 132 and 280 mmol/l, concentrations much higher than in any other milk sample tested at this hospital in a large survey and higher than any we have seen in the literature. Milk of such high sodium content would be unsafe for a baby, and we suggest that, if mothers with cystic fibrosis were to breast feed, the sodium of the mild should be measured first.

This general observation did not correlate with vitamin-E deficiency, age, sex, or severity of the disease.

We examined the sweat of 74 randomly selected children with respiratory asthma during the past 2 years, the sodium and chloride concentrations and bromide index being determined. Sodium and chloride concentrations in the sweat of the asthma children were slightly but significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of the controls. The difference in bromide index was even more significant (P < 0.01). This suggests that C.F. gene carriers are unusually prevalent among children with bronchial asthma. One possibility is that enhanced ion loss in various diseases with allergic pathological mechanisms is secondary in nature. However, this seems unlikely since in our material high sweat-electrolyte concentrations were observed in only a proportion of control children whose illness was similar in severity to that of the asthmatic children, and normal sweat values were obtained even when the child's condition was very serious.", "77136": "Crossley-J-R.

The early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is extremely urgent, since the disease is treatable. The standard test is the sweat test. Over 99 percent of patients with this disease will have elevation of sodium and chloride in the sweat. Three tests are used to assess pancreatic function. First is the measurement of stool trypsin and chymotrypsin. Second, stimulation with hormones - the standard secretin and CCK tests. A third procedure tests carbohydrate tolerance, an increasingly important test since an ever-growing number of patients in late childhood and early adulthood with cystic fibrosis are being found to have diabetes mellitus. The commonest and most important hereditary disease that affects pancreatic function is cystic fibrosis. The commonest form of pancreatic insufficiency in childhood is mucoviscidosis or cystic fibrosis of the pancreas. The incidence of this disease is approximately one per 1000 live births.

Eighteen of the cystic fibrosis group had cholecystograms, and only one had gallstones. In 14 patients with cystic fibrosis who had stopped taking pancreatic enzymes for one week molar percentage of lipid composition accounted for by cholesterol (mean +/- S.E., 16.3 +/- 2.9) and saturation index (2.0 +/- 0.3) were comparable to values of the cholelithiasis group and higher (P less than 0.01) than those of controls. In 12 patients with cystic fibrosis taking pancreatic enzymes, molar percentage of cholesterol (8.6 +/- 1.7) and saturation index (1.0 +/- 0.1) did not differ from those of controls; in cystic fibrosis there was a preponderance of cholic over chenodeoxycholic acid both off (1.7 +/- 0.2) and on (1.9 +/- 0.3) therapy as compared to the cholelithiasis (0.7 +/- 0.1) and control (0.8 +/- 0.0) groups. The glycine/taurine ratio of conjugated bile acids were lower in enzyme-treated patients with cystic fibrosis (3.7 +/- 0.6) than in patients off treatment (6.4 +/- 1.0), but was higher (P less than 0.01) than in controls (1.8 +/- 0.2).

EPITHELIUM: cy.Using a modified rabbit tracheal bioassay, we have confirmed that serum from individuals with bronchial asthma and serum from homozygotes and heterozygotes for CF cause ciliary dyskinesia, whereas normal healthy control sera do not. To evaluate the specificity of the ciliary dyskinesia activity (CDA) detected, we bioassayed serum from eight patients with bronchial asthma. We found that all eight asthmatic sera caused a ciliary dyskinesia reaction; however, sera from asthmatics generally caused a subsequent ciliostasis (cessation of ciliary beating). Concurrent evaluation of all sera for CDA by bioassay and for cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) by electrofocusing showed that all CDA-positive sera except seven of the eight asthmatic sera were also positive for CFP (our specific marker for the CF gene). These two finding indicated that the activity detected in patients with asthma and other respiratory diseases could be a substance different from a CF-specific CDF. To test our hypothesis, we set out to purify the CDAs in asthmatic, CF homozygote and OHCF sera. Representative results clearly indicate that the asthmatic CDA is found in DEAE-II and Sephadex G-200 Fraction II, whereas the CDA found in CF and OHCF sera elutes in DEAE-I and Sephadex G-200 Fractions III and IV (weak CDA). We conclude that the CDAs in asthma and CF are distinct substances. Our findings may facilitate purification of what we feel is a CF-specific CDF from CF and OHCF serum. Purification is a prerequisite to elucidating the exact nature of this substance and its role in the pathophysiology of CF.", "77146": "Peterson-J-A-Jr. Harry-R-D.Intussusception in patients with cystic fibrosis.Nebr-Med-J. 1977 Apr. 62(4).

In all cases, the addition of pancreatic supplement to the general diet improved protein digestibility and utilisation. Substituting 85% of the dietary protein with the enzymic casein hydrolysate resulted in further improvement in nitrogen balance (but not digestibility) for five of the patients. Urinary nitrogen levels of the casein hydrolysate diet tended to be lower, which accounts for the finding above. With the acid-hydrolysed protein, urinary nitrogen was higher when compared with the excretion from the partial casein hydrolysate and provided smaller positive nitrogen balances. These preliminary findings indicate that, for some patients with pancreatic insufficiency, partial hydrolysates have greater potential for nitrogen retention than the administration of exogenous pancreatic extracts with intact protein.

RABBITS. TISSUE-CULTURE. TRACHEA: de.We have developed a modified rabbit tracheal bioassay for use in investigating a possible correlation between cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) and ciliary dyskinesia factor (CDF) in human serum. The bioassay requires high standards of tissue selection, and all epithelial tissue must be free of underlying connective tissue. When serum samples were collected and processed carefully and warmed to 37 degrees before assay, CDF could be reliably detected in 31 of 31 sera from cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes or obligate heterozygotes in 35 min or less without prior fractionation or concentration of sera, whereas 13 of 14 normal control sera were nonreactive. CDF-positive serum reacts in three consecutive phases: (1) initial increase in ciliary beat frequency, (2) ciliary dyskinesia, and (3) tissue destruction with extrusion of single ciliated cells, mucus, and debris. Our results confirm the association of CDF with cystic fibrosis. The bioassay is not specific for CF, however, when whole sera are bioassayed, since serum from several patients with bronchial asthma also caused ciliary dyskinesia. However, this finding need not preclude using rabbit tracheal ciliated epithelial tissue as an assay for following the purification of CDF. Isoelectric focusing showed that the presence or absence of CFP corresponded with that of dyskinesia activity in all sera tested except for the active samples from seven asthma patients, which were negative for CFP. The results indicate that CFP and CDF may be identical or closely related markers for the CF gene, and suggest that the activity detected by the rabbit tracheal bioassay in sera from patients with asthma and other diseases probably is caused by a substance different from a CF- specific CDF.", "77158": "Wilson-G-B.

Thomas and coworkers communicated with us for the purpose of determining possible reasons for their inability to detect CFP by electrofocusing. Key points made during these conversations are reiterated below in a firm attempt to alleviate future problems by inexperienced investigators in their attempts to use analytic electrofocusing to detect CFP. In our communications with Thomas and coworkers we learned that, despite our suggestions, they had not analyzed the samples they screened by either using the equipment of Awdeh et al. or employing our standardized procedure. It is unknown whether or not they exercised the requirements for serum sample collection, processing, and storage.

Since the resolution obtained with their procedure appeared to be inadequate for identifying single protein bands in the relevant region, we have incorporated several methodologic improvements into the isoelectric focusing technique. These improvements have significantly enhanced the resolution and have thus enabled us to demonstrate a greater degree of heterogeneity of serum gamma-globulins than is visible in the paper of Wilson et al. Despite the significant increase in the number of bands resolved by our method, a difference among CF, heterozygote, and control sera in the pH 8.4 - 8.5 region could not be detected. In addition, the two-step IEFAG/disc electrophoresis technique of Altland et al. has been tested in our laboratory. We have also modified this analytic procedure, enabling the fractionation of several small proteins from a portion of the IgG fraction.

The possibility that the effects of the two drugs may be additive was investigated by assessing their combined effects on glandular and salivary C++ and protein in the rat submaxillary gland. Individually, their effects were also assessed in relation to the dose used. Results indicate that: (1) treatment for 7 days with 0.05, 0.50, and 5.0 mg/kg daily dose of reserpine caused, respectively, a 45%, 95%, and 120% increase in glandular Ca++ and a 9.3%, 16.5%, and 37.4% increase in glandular protein; (2) treatment for 7 days with a 5.0 mg/kg daily dose of isoproterenol caused a 138% increase in gland Ca++ and a 12.38% increase in gland protein. Treatment with a 5.0 mg/rat daily dose of this drug caused increases of 166% and 10.3% in gland Ca++ and protein; (3) in experiments involving a combination of the two drugs, isoproterenol was administered in a 5.0 mg/kg daily dose from days 1-7 and reserpine in a 0.5 mg/kg daily dose from days 4-10 of the treatment schedule. This procedure resulted in (a) a 217% increase in gland Ca++ and a 25.7% increase in gland protein; (b) a marked accumulation of a granular, basophilic material in acinar cells and the development of intraductal precipitates; (c) the secretion of turbid saliva with high Ca++ and protein concentrations after a secretory dose of isoproterenol (this type of stimulation also reduced the gland Ca++ (50%) and protein (20%) contents and produced vacuolization in the acinar cells); (d) the secretion of saliva with elevated Ca++ and protein in response to pilocarpine (these elevated concentrations were, however, one-fifth of those obtained after isoproterenol stimulation); (e) the secretion of smaller volume of saliva after both types of stimulation. These findings indicate that both IPR and reserpine have a dose-related and significant effect on submaxillary gland Ca++ and protein and that their individual effects are synergistic.

A linear correlation between increased S-adenosyl methionine activity and putrescine concentration was apparent in all cell lines. A putrescine concentration of 0.8 mM was optimal for enhancement of SAM decarboxylase activity. The passage number of the cell line correlated inversely with maximal putrescine-stimulated SAM decarboxylase activity, earlier passage numbers having the highest specific activity (Fig. 1). No significant differences in basal or putrescine-stimulated SAM decarboxylase activity were noted between normal fibroblast cultures and cells from patients with cystic fibrosis (Fig. 2). SAM decarboxylase activity increased as the cell lines approached confluence. Activity was lowest during exponential growth (Fig. 3).

The first modification ensured adequate dissolution of the CFP-IgG complexes (or other precursor complexes which may liberate CFP). The second modification ensured a linear gradient (between pH 3.8 and pH 9.2), excellent resolution in the pH 8--9 region, and the separation of CFP within 2 hr without overheating of the gel. Electrofocusing with the LKB Multiphor permits the detection of CFP in as many as 24 serum samples per gel.

PHAGOCYTOSIS.Pulmonary clearance for Staphylococcus aureus has been examined in two inbred strains of mice with some hereditary alterations resembling cystic fibrosis (CF). These mice were mice with abnormal electrolyte metabolism (DBA/@J-cri), mice with spontaneous pneumonitis (C57BL/6J-bg), and mice without any CF-like alterations (BALB/c). The methods used to produce pulmonary infection were essentially those of Laurenzi and associates adapted as needed for mutant mice. The animals mentioned above were exposed to a finely divided aerosol suspension of a coagulase-positive strain of S. aureus in phosphate buffer. Immediately after the exposure, half of the animals were killed, and the remaining half were killed 4 hr later. In each experimental unit the mice killed immediately after the exposure were as similar as possible to the mice killed 4 hr later with respect to genotype, age, and sex; some were siblings. The uncleared bacteria (UBR) in 4 hr were 0.20 for the mice without any CF-like alterations (BALB/c) and the C57BL/6J-bg, bg/bg genotypes; 0.28 for C57BL/6J-bg, +/? genotypes; 0.50 for the DBA/2J-cri, +/? genotypes; and 0.56 for cri/cri mice. The number of viable staphylococci found immediately after the aerosol exposure (Co) in the C57BL/6J-bg strain is significantly lower than the Co of the BALB/c (P < 0.05) and DBA/2J-cri strain (P < 0.01). The latter two did not differ from each other. There was no sex difference with respect to the UBR and Co data. The DBA/2J-cri strain of mice, where the cri mutation first appeared, has a decreased capacity for clearance of S. aureus by the lung. Together with the other CF-like alterations of the cri mutation, namely failure for the reabsorption of Na+ by the parotid duct, high level of Na+ in the fur, and CF abnormal serum factor activity in the serum of the cri/cri mice, we suggest that the cribriform degeneration mouse mutant may provide a potential animal model for studying CF.

ISOELECTRIC-FOCUSING.This study utilized isoelectric focusing and electrophoresis in an attempt to detect a cystic fibrosis (CF) serum factor(s), for which there is considerable indirect evidence. The method of isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels (IEFAG) specified by Wilson et al. (53), as reproduced in our laboratory, did not enable the detection of a CF factor protein reported to focus near pH 8.4-8.5. Consequently, we employed our modified IEFAG techniques, which enabled us to demonstrate significantly enhanced resolution and striking heterogeneity in serum gamm-globulins. Despite the significant increase in the number of bands resolved by our methods, neither a difference at pH 8.4-8.5 nor other differences throughout the alkaline pH range could be detected consistently in the CF and heterozygous sera. The two-step IEFAG/disc electrophoresis technique outline by Altland et al. (2), as reproduced in our laboratory, indicated that at least one small, cationic protein could be fractioned from all serum samples. Improvements in the method of disc electrophoresis resulted in the observation of numerous bands from some samples and of differences among the samples, but no protein band unique to the CF genotypes was observed. Our approach, employing different electrophoresis techniques and varying the conditions of sample analysis, should have increased the likelihood of detecting a protein or proteins specific for the CF genotypes. Despite the many variations in our approach, no consistently unique protein was observed in the CF or heterozygous sera. A CF serum factor cannot be readily demonstrated by the electrophoretic techniques described. The value of the \"biophysical assay\" and the \"nonbiologic technique\" reported in the literature is suspect, and the promise and applicability of these techniques as diagnostic tests for the CF gene should be carefully evaluated.", "77166": "Callahan-J-W.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: et. HUMAN. TRACHEA. ULTRAFILTRATION.Purified serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), derived from eight cystic fibrosis (CF) and five carrier subjects, has been shown to be responsible for the mucociliary disturbances noted in the rabbit tracheal bioassay. A small molecular substance of less than 10,000 but greater than 1,000 daltons (by Amicon filtration) was found associated with gamma-globulin fractions isolated from sera of these same cystic patients and their parents. Once separated by PM-10 ultrafiltration, this small substance was unable to promote the ciliary dyskinesia response in eight of eight CF and five of five CF carrier individuals unless pooled purified human IgG was added. In addition, the IgG-rich fraction retained by PM-10 ultrafiltration was still able to promote the ciliary dyskinesia response in the bioassay, an event noted in our earlier work with whole serum. The size of the small serum substance and its association with IgG closely corresponds to that described for the oyster test system, as well as to that produced by cultured cells derived from homozygotes and heteroxygotes for this genetic disorder. The persistence of the ability to promote mucociliary disturbances by the IgG-rich retentate PM-10 fractions may be indicative of the ineffective molecular separation by the Amicon ultransfiltration apparatus or may represent another CF-related, IgG-associated substance not influenced by ultrafiltration. Speculation The genetic disturbance of CF can be explained by the presence of a molecule(s) which has an affinity for IgG, which in turn gives rise to the various physiologic facets of this disorder. This molecule(s) is present in CF only because of a deficiency of an enzyme which normally controls its level by inactivation.", "77168": "Wilson-G-B.

SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-P-H-S.The cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) and ciliary dyskinesia activities (CDA) in sera from CF homozygotes, heterozygote carriers, and individuals with bronchial asthma have been partially purified. Concurrently, the CDA's in sera from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or bronchial asthma were shown to be different substances by ion- exchange or gel permeation chromatographic procedures. Sephadex G-200 chromatography indicated that the CF-CDA eluted with a protein fraction of molecular weight (MW) 68,000-150,000 and that the asthma CDA was found in a protein fraction of MV greater than 150,000. The two activities could also be separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Prior acidification of whole normal, CF homozygote, obligate heterozygote, or asthmatic sera to pH 3.7 using EDTA, followed by fractionation of Sephadex G-200 removed all the CDA's from fractions of highermolecular weight and shifted the activities to a protein fraction of MW 1,100-13,700. This procedure afforded a 200-fold purification of the CDA's in sera from patients with asthma or CF. EDTA treatment, however, also generated a CDA in previously nonreactive normal sera. Subsequent fractionation of the various active G-200 fractions on Bio-Gel P10 allowed for the separation of three separate activities (Bio-Gel Fractions I, II-IV, and V). Fraction I was shown to represent the activity in sera from patients with asthma and was determined to be C3a (MW 9,000). Fraction I was also found in normal, CF, and carrier sera and therefore is not a specific CDA. Fraction II-IV is thought to represent a CF-specific CDA (MW 5,000) since it could not be demonstrated in either normal or asthmatic sera but was found in sera of obligate heterozygotes. Fraction III-IV also did not react with antisera to human C3a. Fraction V was generated from all serum types upon acidification of the serum with EDTA and is thought to be a nonspecific CDA. Bio-Gel P10 filtration of Sephadex G-200 fractions provided 823-fold and 650- fold purification of the asthmatic and CF CDA's, respectively. Concurrent analysis of column fractions for CDA's by bioassay and for CFP by electrofocusing showed CFP only in fractions that contained the CF-CDA. Combined analyses employing acid disc gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and EDTA treatment of active CF-immunoglobulin (Ig) G and Sephadex G-200 column fractions, followed by Bio-Gel P10 chromatography, provided evidence that CFP was associated with the CF-CDA.

This work was undertaken because enterokinase is considered a brush border enzyme, the release of which into the intestinal lumen is influenced by pancreatic enzymes, and also because we have recently shown a small bowel mucosal dysfunction in patients with CF. As expected, sucrase activity was reduce (p < .05) in children with CD as compared to the other three groups. On the other hand, enterokinase activity in children with pancreatic insufficiency (CF and CEPH) was higher (p < .05) than that of control subjects. The present study has shown that in patients with CF and CEPH, mucosal enterokinase activity was increased as compared to control subjects.

Ouabain is generally assumed to act primarily at the level of the cell membrane and to cause killing of cells by inhibiting ion transport. We have therefore examined the ability of normal and CF cells to survive exposure to ethacrynic acid, another inhibitor of ion transport, and to survive colchicine and aminopterin, resistance to which has been associated with membrane alterations in other cells. The effect of dexamethasone, which has a sterol nucleus similar to that of ouabain but is thought to have a different site of cellular action, was also tested. Exposure of the cells to ethacrynic acid, colchicine, or aminopterin did not reveal any differences in survival between normal and CF fibroblasts. However, CF cells survived exposure to dexamethasone significantly better than normal cells did. These results suggest that normal and CF cells do not differ in terms of a generalized resistance to ion transport inhibitors or to drugs that must pass through the membrane to be active. Instead, the results raise the possibility that CF cells have an enhanced resistance to drugs that have the sterol nucleus found in ouabain and dexamethasone.", "77185": "Epstein-J.

In medium containing the usual amount of potassium (6.25 mM), survival of the CF cells exposed to ouabain was decreased to that of the normal cells.

The lipoprotein (LP) antibody levels of healthy subjects and of patients with varied enterobacterial infections were determined. None of the healthy children and only one of the healthy adults had antibodies against LP. In contrast, 18% of the children with peritonitis complicating appendicitis, 24% of patients with enterobacterial infection of the respiratory tract complicating cystic fibrosis, and 42% of adult subjects with bacteremia complicating malignancy, had LP antibodies in the serum.

The histological evaluation was carried out on a blind basis in order to avoid bias. Among the parameters used, the tissue eosinophilia proved to be the most valuable factor in the differentiation between CF and non-CF polyps, as only few eosinophils were found in the CF-polyps. The polyp glands were few and generally pathological. Some characteristics abnormalities in the grandular morphology are apparently more common in CF polyps. It is concluded, that the histological examination of nasal polyps is of importance for the correct classification of the patient, but the diagnosis of CF cannot be made based on microscopy of polyps.

P 42-3.CYSTIC-FIBROSIS.CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di, nu. HUMAN. INFANT. INFANT-NEWBORN.Cystic fibrosis (C.F.) is a serious genetic disorder occurring mainly among the Whites and starting in early childhood or even at birth. The name is a shortening of the old term Cystic Fibrosis (or Fibrocystic disease) of the pancreas. This comes from the historical appearance at post-mortem first described by Landsteiner in 1905. It was only in 1938 that Dorothee Anderson and Fanconi realised that the disease was a separate entity and not simply a manifestation of other illnesses. Another name is Mucoviscidosis which gives a clue as to one of the most important features of the disease. Mucus formed is thicker and stickier (more viscid) than normal and tends to clog up the bronchi and ducts, particularly the pancreatic ducts. Chronic bronchitis with recurrent severe infection and malabsorption are the main symptoms of the disease. The other important abnormality is an increased amount of sodium chloride (salt) in the sweat. This fact, used in the diagnosis, was first realised during a heat wave in New York in 1953 when it was noticed that most of the children with heat prostration suffered from C.F. Little is known of the causes of the abnormalities of sweat and mucus. Some generalised cell abnormality (? enzymatic) seems possible. There is no doubt that the condition is genetically transmitted and most evidence favours a recessive mode of inheritance.", "77196": "Skude-G.On human amylase isoenzymes.Scand-J-Gastroenterol [Suppl]. 1977. 12(44).

Sera from the patients were examined by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis for the occurence and number of precipitating antibody specificites against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Poor prognosis in cystic fibrosis was associated with chronic colonization (9 months - more than 5 years) of the respiratory tract with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and with an onset of the chronic colonization before puberty. Among the patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, poor prognosis was associated with high numbers of precipitins against antigens from these bacteria (up to 61). The number of Pseudomonas aeruginosa precipitins increased on an average with five per year in chronically colonized patients. Rapidly increasing number of precipitins was associated with poor prognosis. Patients with any degree of impairment of the ventilatory function and any changes on the chest radiographs could contract chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. Poor ventilatory function and severe changes on the chest radiographs was associated with high numbers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa precipitins and with poor prognosis.

Approximately 90% of these children developed N.D. and the changes ranged from mild to severe. Approximately two-thirds of children with cystic fibrosis, congestive heart failure and chronic renal failure developed N.D. and the changes were mostly mild. Only one-third of patients with congenital biliary atresia and malnutrition developed N.D. and the changes were always mild. The frequency and severity of N.D. increased in patients who had prolonged clinical courses; no N.D. was seen in patients who died from acute cases such as trauma, acute infection, intoxication, acute renal failure or prematurity.

However, the intrinsic advantages of X-ray microanalysis and the results obtained in this study suggest that this method, after further testing, may be a useful diagnostic acid for cystic fibrosis. In comparison with neutron activation analysis, X-ray microanalysis has the advantage of simultaneously giving the concentrations of several elements and may be accessible at any hospital with an electron microscope fitted with the necessary equipment.

Plasma concentrations of vitamin A, RBP, albumin, and zinc decreased with age in the CF group but not in the controls. The data support previous suggestions that low plasma vitamin A levels in CF are due to defects in the retinol transport system. The zinc status of the CF groups as a whole was judged to be low-normal however a subgroup of CF patients were in the marginal to deficient category.

The original method of sweat chloride analysis proposed by the Orion Research Corporation (Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139) is inadequate because it produces erratic and misleading results. The modified method was compared with the reference quantitative method of Gibson and Cooke. In the modified method, individual electrode pads are cut and placed in the electrodes rather than using the pads supplied by the company; pilocarpine nitrate (2,000 mg/l) is used in place of pilocarpine HCl (640 mg/l); sodium bicarbonate as the weak electrolyte is used instead of K2SO4. A 10-minute period for sweat accumulation is employed rather than a zero-time collection as in the original Orion method. The modification has been studied for reproducibility in individuals, reproducibility between right and left arm in individuals; it has been compared extensively with the quantitative method of Gibson and Cooke, both in normal individuals and in patients with cystic fibrosis. There is excellent agreement between the modified method and the quantitative reference method. There appears to be a slight bias toward higher concentrations of chloride from the right arm compared with the left arm, but this difference is not medically significant.", "78015": "Rosenstein-B-J.Cystic fibrosis presenting with the meconium plug syndrome.Am-J-Dis-Child. 1978 Feb. 132(2).

SYNDROME.We have observed severe meconium plug syndrome (MPS) in a newborn infant who was found during the neonatal period to have extensive exocrine pancreatic deficiency. Cystic fibrosis was excluded by several sweat chloride tests. Our observation of MPS in a patient with exocrine pancreatic deficiency suggests that the MPS observed in the CF patients reported by Rosenstein is probably caused by pancreatic deficiency. The frequent occurrence of meconium ileus (MI) in CF and the rarity of MPS in CF is curious, since they may be different manifestations of the same pathologic process. Conceivably, MPS may occur with total absence of pancreatic enzymes (as in our patient and in a few patients with CF). Low levels of enzymes in CF may limit expression to meconium ileus. We wish to suggest the evaluation of exocrine pancreatic function in these patients even if CF has been excluded by sweat tests. - There is conflicting, albeit fragmentary, data suggesting that exocrine pancreatic deficiency may not be the sole cause of meconium obstruction in CF. Several investigators have suggested that MI may be the result of abnormal protein and mucoprotein secretions by the intestinal goblet cells and not from lack of pancreatic enzymes alone. While these observations suggest that exocrine pancreatic deficiency may not play a major role in all instance of meconium obstruction, it is important to note that there may be little correlation between the histologic appearance of the pancreas and exocrine function.", "78018": "Spiro-R-K.

Except for a greater incidence of hepatotoxicity with CG (23 per cent versus 3 per cent; p is less than 0.02), there was no difference in toxicity, colonization with drug-resistant microorganisms or superinfection between the two treatment groups.

Twenty-two of the patients were in the midst of a relatively long-lasting flare-up of pulmonary infection. There was no other consistent precipitating event. All but 7 of the patients were admitted after the initial episode and were treated with parenteral antimicrobial drugs. Postural drainage was resumed as rapidly as possible after cessation of acute bleeding. Vitamin K was administered to all patients. Volumes of expectorated blood were as large as 2,500 ml with the initial episode. Blood pressure changes occurred in 4 patients. Five patients received blood transfusions. Bleeding stopped without surgical intervention in all patients, usually within 4 days. The 38 patients had a total of 85 episodes of bleeding. No surgical treatment was undertaken at this center. One patient underwent a lobectomoy at another hospital but continued to bleed postoperatively. Ten patients died (mean survival after hemoptysis, 2.5 years; range, 3 months to 6 years). This survival rate is comparable to that of another group of patients with equally severe lung disease who had never bled profusely. The other 28 patients remain alive from 7 months to 20 years after their initial episode. Our dat suggest that massive hemoptysis complicating cystic fibrosis may not be as ominous an event as has been believed in the past.

Differences in the concentrations of both mucous and serum glycoproteins were greater among different macroscopic types of sputum than among diseases for the same macroscopic type. Comparison between diseases showed that sputum from patients with asthma had the widest variation in concentrations of markers of mucous glycoprotein and dry macromolecular weight. When the astham group was further analyzed, it became apparent that patients with extrinsic asthma without chronic bronchitis represented a homogeneous group, whereas those with intrinsic asthma, with or without chronic bronchitis, were responsible for the wide variation. The concentrations of markers of mucous and serum glycoproteins in a sputum sample were correlated with the apparent viscosity of the sputum to establish the relative contribution of the glycoproteins to the viscosity of sputum. In mucoid sputum, the mucous glycoprotein was most important in determining the viscosity, whereas when in infected sputum, both mucous and serum components contributed to the viscosity.", "78025": "Stern-R-C.

Possession of a single CF gene seems therefore sufficient for expression of the cyclic variation. In substantial agreement with the Dutch series, maximum frequencies were found to occur in March or April and in September.

In our experience a much greater problem of sweat test accuracy occurs in hospitals where the test is carried out on a very much smaller number of patients and where the laboratory has a much lesser degree of experience than that of the authors. We have had a significant number of patients referred to our regional children's hospital who have had abnormal sweat electrolyte measurements elsewhere, but unequivocally normal measurements when repeated by a laboratory carrying out a large number of tests. We have not needed to go to the extent of serial collections of sweat and of giving spironolactone as have the authors. If we obtain a test within the 'grey area' on repeated occasions, we carefully seek other evidence of the disease, particularly evidence of pancreatic disease. - We do not advocate the general use of spironolactone: the merit of this drug in our experiments on certain patients was merely to support our suspicion of temporary hyperaldosteronism, a condition which might have led to erroneous conclusions in the absence of K or Cl determinations.", "78031": "Turner-M-W.

Although a reduction in steatorrhoea was nearly always accompanied by a decrease in bile acid excretion, the initial bile acid loss was very variable and could not be predicted for any given degree of steatorrhoea.

MASS-SCREENING.Bray et al. conclude that the mass screening of newborn babies with chloride ion-selective electrodes is a feasible method for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis; they also suggest that this procedure might be used in conjunction with meconium analysis to reduce the incidence of false positive results. In 1972 we reported the details of a child with proved cystic fibrosis in whom raised sweat sodium but normal sweat chloride levels were obtained during treatment with cloxacillin. Attention was drawn to the implication of the finding with regard to screening procedures, and the suggestion was made that, in at least some children with cystic fibrosis, the cloxacillin radical might replace the chloride ion in the sweat. When mass screening for cystic fibrosis is to be undertaken using methods based on the estimation of sweat chloride levels, it is therefore prudent to inquire whether the infant is receiving medication from any source and, if so, to interpret the results with caution. - These are instances of false-negative sweat chloride readings, but there is no evidence yet from our 1205 tests of any negative cystic fibrosis sweat chloride; the statistical chance of this is in any case small. These several cases suggest a need for a systematic investigation of the effect of medication on sweat ion levels in general as well as in cystic fibrosis cases.", "78038": "Silverman-M. Hobbs-F-D.

It seems that the small airways are the important site of obstruction in a variety of chronic respiratory disorders associated with airflow obstruction. This review deals with the anatomic and functional aspects of small airways in normal and diseased lungs. In particular, the basis of obstruction or narrowing that is not dependent on intrinsic airway lesion is reviewed. The variety of pathologic changes in small airways observed in these diseases are outlined along with physiologic tests that are currently used to detect dysfunction at a stage long before they produce symptoms or alter standard tests of lung function.", "78041": "Beckerman-R-C.

FEMALE. HUMAN. INFANT. INFANT-NEWBORN. MALE.Cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disorder, remains the most common lethal genetic disease of Caucasian people. The diagnosis of CF is usually made based upon the clinical presentation of chronic respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, a positive sweat electrolyte test and, often, a family history of the disorder. The manifestations of chronic cough, recurrent pneumonias, bronchiectasis with clubbing, pneumothorax, hemoptysis, and malabsorption secondary to pancreatic insufficiency are so well associated with cystic fibrosis that the diagnosis is usually not delayed. However, it is often not appreciated by physicians that CF may be associated with a broad spectrum of less common manifestations as well as extreme variability in severity of illness. Lack of familiarity with these manifestations may delay diagnosis until adolescence or adulthood. First, there seems to be mild clinical expression of the disorder in some patients (genetic variability). Second, the subtle manifestations of CF are not widely appreciated by physicians in practice.", "78042": "Davidson-G-P. Phelan-P-D.

SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-NON-P-H-S.Diploid skin fibroblasts derived from individuals with the autosomal recessive disease, cystic fibrosis (CF), were shown previously to be significantly more resistant to the cytotoxicity of dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid hormone, than were normal human fibroblasts. Here cystic fibrosis fibroblasts are also shown to be more resistant than normal human fibroblasts to the cytotoxic effects of the sex hormones, 17 beta-estradiol, dihydrotestosterone and progesterone. Since cells are believed to contain different receptors for each of the steroid hormones, it is not probable than the resistance of CF cells to these hormones results from a receptor deficiency. This was shown by the fact that CF cells were found to exhibit the same receptor activity as normal cells for 3-H-dexamethasone. Furthermore, neither normal human nor CF fibroblasts could be demonstrated to contain detectable receptor activity for 3H-17 beta-estradiol. In addition, the studies of fibroblast killing by hormones led to the further interesting observation that normal human diploid fibroblasts, regardless of the sex of the tissue donor, are sensitive to killing by each of the sex hormones. These findings suggest that the cytotoxic effects of the steroid hormones may be observed independently of the specific hormone receptors. The studies reported here thus suggest that the resistance of CF cells to the different steroid hormones is probably the result of a defect in a pathway in cellular steroid hormone metabolism other than that involving receptors.", "78060": "Treton-J.

Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis has been suggested because early diagnosis permits genetic counselling of parents and improved treatment and prognosis for cystic fibrosis patients. The fact that cystic fibrosis newborns have abnormally high meconium albumin seems to offer the best screening approach. Because we have had equivocal and false positive results with meconium albumin test strips, we have developed a nephelometric automated immunoprecipitation method for the quantitative and specific analysis of meconium albumin. On a total of 3895 meconiums so far examined, eleven albumin elevations of undetermined origin have been detected. Nine of these were associated with prematurity. There have been, so far, no detected true positives and no known false negatives. The normal range for meconium albumin is in agreement with previously published ranges determined using manual immunochemical methods. This method is rapid and economic.

Its purpose is to focus attention on an area considered by the author to be of great importance for elucidating the primary biochemical defect in CF. The majority of the studies on glycoproteins in CF have been done on crude mixtures of glycoproteins from tissues or tissue fluids, secretions or excretions. Very few studies have compared the properties and composition of purified glycoproteins from CF patients and controls. Comparative studies on the enzymes involved in the degradation and biosynthesis of the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins in CF patients and normal controls are discussed. Several studies have suggested abnormalities in CF alpha-L-fucosidase and CF L-fucose metabolism. There are several studies which indirectly suggest that abnormalities in glycoproteins or their metabolism may be involved in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis. Fruitful areas for future investigation are comparison of the properties and composition of specific glycoproteins purified to homogeneity from CF and control tissues, particularly with regard to carbohydrate composition; comparison of the activities and properties of the enzymes involved in both the degradation and biosynthesis of glycoproteins in CF and control tissues; and studies of the effects of increased electrolyte concentration on the physical-chemical properties of glycoproteins.", "78076": "Alhadeff-J-A.

On the other hand, precipitins to Staphylococcus alpha-hemolysin was the main type of immunoprecipitin detected in CF serum and was found in 60% of the serum specimens examined. It seems likely that the precipitins in patients with CF may be involved in the formation of immune complexes which, in conjunction with complement, may be responsible for the respiratory and gastrointestinal lesions that are common in patients with CF. The immune complexes may be the result of excess food and bacterial antigens escaping across the gut and lungs as a result of some abnormality of the SIgA system. Over 80% of the sputum specimens tested gave positive precipitins in agar gel against human seminal fluid and colostrum, suggesting that some of the antibodies formed in CF patients could be directed against host tissue, and may account for an autoimmune-type reaction in CF. Crossreaction between the high-titer antibody to Staphylococcus and basement membrane of lungs and pancreas, with complement activation, may occur in CF and required further study.

They are of great interest to biochemists and geneticists, as well as to paediatricians and internist for whom they often present special diagnostic and therapeutic problems. The study of the inborn errors of metabolism also has implications in the fields of epidemiology and social medicine. The number of known inborn errors of metabolism has increased rapidly in recent years, and others, as yet unidentified, presumably await recognition. Only a few of these conditions can be treated now, but the realisation that early diagnosis is essential in order to achieve good results has stimulated interest in the possibility of examining either whole populations or selected predisposed groups of individuals for biochemical differences which characterise particular inherited metabolic diseases. This article reviews some recent developments with particular reference to the indications for such screening programmes and progress in the identification of previously unknown inborn errors of metabolism in otherwise homogeneous population groups. The inborn errors of metabolism are due to single gene mutations. Recognition of the asymptomatic individuals who are heterozygous for the abnormal gene causing the disease may be important clinically and the identification has to be considered as one aspect of metabolic screening for the inborn errors of metabolism.", "78086": "Neutra-M-R.

CHILD. CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: bl. FEMALE. HEPARIN: an, bl. HUMAN. MALE. METHODS. MIDDLE-AGE.A method for estimating a 'heparin binding capacity' of human serum is described. When human serum is diluted with a low ionic strength, heparin-containing buffer at pH 5.5, protein-heparin electrostatic complexes form in solution with subsequent formation of insoluble aggregates which can be collected by centrifugation. Quantitative determination of the relative amounts by weight of protein and heparin in the insoluble heparin-protein aggregates permits estimation of a combining ratio at which serum proteins bind with heparin to precipitate from solution. This weight combining ratio of protein and heparin is a quantitative measure of the total affinity for heparin of all proteins in serum which bind heparin at pH 5.57 to form an insoluble complex. An unusually high affinity for heparin by an abnormal serum protein or an increase in amount of a normally- occuring, high heparin-affinity, serum protein would alter the average protein: heparin combining ratio and increase the 'heparin- binding capacity' of human serum. The converse would be true for serum proteins having a low affinity for heparin, lowering the 'heparin-binding capacity' of human serum. The described method was used to evaluate the 'heparin-binding capacity' of serum proteins in normal individuals and in persons with cystic fibrosis.", "78088": "Marchi-A-G. Marchi-M-A. Cigui-I.

SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-P-H-S.Cystic fibrosis, the most common lethal genetic trait of Caucasians, causes much of the chronic progressive lung disease in children and young adults. It is also responsible for intestinal obstruction at birth (meconium ileus), pancreatic insufficiency with maldigestion and failure to grow, and obstructive liver disease in this age group. Furthermore, obliteration of the vas deferens causes aspermia and infertility in most males with CF. Individuals with CF secrete sweat which contains excessive amounts of chloride and sodium. Diagnostic criteria include detection of elevated chloride levels in sweat of individuals with typical pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or genital manifestations of the disease. There are several, well documented alterations in the mucous secretions of individuals with cystic fibrosis, any of which alone or in combination, may interfere with mucous clearance from the lung or from passageways of other organs. It seems clear that additional studies to define basic aspects of normal mucous biochemistry, physiology and pharmacology must precede or parallel studies of CF mucous secretions if data pertinent to CF pathophysiology are to be generated. Particular needs include an understanding of the chemical determinants of physical and rheological properties of these secretions, and elucidation of mechanisms for control of sulfated glycoprotein biosynthesis.", "78095": "Sahu-S.

The specificity and sensitivity of this combination of tests were 99.67% and 78.57% respectively. The prevalence of CF at birth was confirmed as 1:3600 in this country. This low prevalence resulted in a relatively high number of false positives. Therefore, a positive test result has a low predictive value [3.39%] and this is a serious drawback of the method. The experiences and opinions of 37 local paediatricians about the screening programme were evaluated by a simple questionnaire. Gold's decision rule was applied. The least relative cost of misclassification justifying a mass-screening programme was 3 times higher than the actual relative cost as suggested by the aggregate opinion of paediatricians in the region.

The numbers of new patients have increased from six in 1964 to 12 in 1974. Both sexes have been equally affected. Respiratory infections, failure to thrive and diarrhoea were the predominant presenting features in that order, and thus any one of these presenting features should indicate that cystic fibrosis should at least be considered and excluded. Each patient was assessed monthly at the clinic during which attendance formal physiotherapy was carried out and the parents were instructed in the techniques of percussion and drainage. Forty-two of our sixty-four patients are still alive and thirty-three of those fall into the excellent category, seven into the good and one each into the fair and poor. During the period of this review there has been an obvious improvement with a fall in morbidity and mortality and with the increasing proportion of patients now in the \"excellent\" group.

The procedure was verified by recovering known distributions from data to which noise had been added. Using an apparatus to control the subject's tidal volume and FRC, mixed expired N2 data gave the following results: a) the distributions of young, normal subjects were narrow and unimodal with a mean ln standard deviation of 0.56 plus or minus 0.13; b) those of subjects over age 40 were broader (ln SD 0.86 plus or minus 0.19) with more poorly ventilated units; c) patients with pulmonary disease of all descriptions showed enlarged dead space; d) patients with cystic fibrosis showed multimodal distributions with the bulk of the ventilation going to overventilated units; and e) patients with obstructive lung diseases fell into several classes, three of which are illustrated.

In young normals the emptying patterns are narrow and unimodal throughout the alveolar plateau with little or no flow from the dead space at the end of the breath. Older normals show more flow from the dead space, particularly toward the end of the breath, and some show a high V/V0 mode early in the breath. Patients with obstructive lung disease have a high flow from the dead space which is present throughout the breath.

Exotoxin A was purified from a low-protease strain of P. aeruginosa and shown to have adenosine diphosphate-ribose transferase activity and mouse lethality. Proteases were purified from an isolate of P. aeruginosa from a patient with cystic fibrosis and had proteolytic activity against elastin and collagen in an assay employing dimethylated protein substrates.

Inverse correlations were found between these ratios for each of the pseudomonas exoproducts and clinical scores; highest ratios occurred in patients showing the lowest clinical scores.

SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-P-H-S.Cell-free culture medium from PHA-stimulated PBL cultures or long-term lymphoid cell lines from CF homozygotes or obligate heterozygotes, as well as serum from such individuals, can produce three distinct changes in the ciliary beat of rabbit tracheal ciliated epithelium: (1) increased beat frequency, (2) CD, and (3) ciliostasis. The ability to produce both 1 and 2 seems to be characteristic for leukocyte cultures from CF genotypes: 46 of 49 CF cultures produced both effects, as compared with none of 16 cultures from normal controls and 1 of 10 from non-CF patient controls with bronchial asthma. CTA was not specific for CF PBL cultures, since 13% of normal control and 60% of the non-CF patient control cultures produced ciliostasis. Similar findings were obtained when serum from the same individuals or culture medium from long-term lymphoid cell lines was tested. Using protein A from Staphylococcus aureus covalently coupled to Sepharose CL-4B as a reagent, we separated the CDAs present in serum and in culture medium from PBL and lymphoid cultures. Protein A specifically adsorbs IgG and binds it under mild conditions at physiological pH. The CDAs are noncovalently bound to IgG at physiological pH and can be co-purified with IgG. The IgG-CDA complexes can be readily desorbed from protein A-Sepharose CL-4B at pH 3.0, and under these conditions the CDAs are dissociated from IgG, retain all their activity, and can be separated by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-10 or Sephadex G-200. Three distinct activities were removed from serum or PBL cultures which showed both CDA and CTA, and two were obtained from samples which showed only CDA. One CDA believed to be specific for CF (CF-CDA) was separated from CF serum and PBL or lymphoid cell culture medium. This CF-CDA was complexed noncovalently to IgG (not subclass IgG3), had a molecular weight of 4000 to 6000, was stable as acid pH, was found in biological fluids from both homozygotes and heterozygotes for CF, was shown not to be C3a (anaphylatoxin), did not require IgG for activity, and was positively charged at pH values more acidic than 8.0.", "78113": "Moller-N-E.

In CF infants over 6 mth of age, but not in controls, there was an increase along the gut from duodenum to ileum of both weakly acidic and strongly acidic sulphomucins. In the ileum the increase was in total mucins from 6 mth previously in the same CF patients and this difference could be accounted for by an increase of sialidase-resistant mucins. The increase in sulphomucins was more marked at the tip than at the base of the villi. In CF neonates there was significant difference in the quantities of acidic mucins. The question whether the mucins of CF are chemically abnormal or merely accumulated to an abnormal extent is probably best investigated by analysis of sialidase-resistant mucins and sulphomucins of the ileum and strongly acidic sulphomucins of the duodenum and jejunum in CF infants over 6 mth of age.", "78116": "Buts-J-P.

In a nonceliac group of 63 children with abnormally low xylose levels, almost all were found to have clinical conditions compatible with upper small bowel mucosal impairment.

Cumulative percent PABA recovery in six hours was significantly lower in CF patients compared with the control group. No overlap was noted between the two groups.

In those patients with CF who were over 5 years of age, one group had high and one group had low lactase activity, as occurs in healthy Caucasian control subjects of the same age. This finding supports the view that in patients with CF, lactase deficiency is not related to the disease entity. In patients with or without CF who had the same degree of mucosal atrophy, the decrease of disaccharidase activities followed the same pattern, indicating that enzyme activities are affected to the same extent by the damage of the mucosa.

Hereditary pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant trait with apparently complete penetrance, though markedly variable expressivity. It would be reasonable to point out that hereditary pancreatitis should be entertained whenever an alternative diagnosis is not documented, even without a positive family history. - We agree with the statement by Jordan and Ament in a recent article that \"acute pancreatitis is one of the rarer causes of abdominal pain in children and is among the least reported and characterized.\" However, their discussion of this problem is surprisingly incomplete. Familial pancreatitis, one of the most important causes of pancreatitis in childhood, is not even mentioned; cystic fibrosis is barely acknowledged. These two conditions as well as hypolipoproteinemia and ascariasis (also not mentioned) should be included in the differential diagnosis of pancreatitis in children and of otherwise unexplained abdominal pain in this age group. - We appreciate the concern that we did not diagnose hereditary pancreatitis in any of our patients. None of the ten patients with \"idiopathic pancreatitis\" had a family history of pancreatitis documented in their charts. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is not a common cause of pancreatitis in our center.

The results accord with the original hypothesis of Burns and May. In 13 of 20 patients the sputum bacterial flora changed as the hypothesis of Burns and May predicted. This preliminary data suggests that one of the primary sputum abnormalities in cystic fibrosis may be increased Ca++ which makes the sputum susceptible to colonisation by S. aureus. After infection the Ca++ concentration is reduced and the lung becomes susceptible to colonisation by other microorganisms including H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.", "78143": "Sparham-P-D.

RATS.Dr Freed and Dr Buckley have shown that a lectin, concanavalin A (Con A), causes severe rhinitis, sinusitis, and increased mucus secretion when inhaled by man or small-intestinal colic, foul-smelling flatus, and mucus-coated stools if ingested. It is somewhat surprising that the authors suggest that a suitable inhaled or ingested lectin may be useful in treating patients with cystic fibrosis, since the very symptoms produced by the ingested lectin resemble those associated with the disease. A more attractive recommendation would be for patients with cystic fibrosis to avoid substances containing lectins such as Con A to avoid stimulating additional mucus release. The underlying pathogenetic defect in cystic fibrosis may be inappropriate, excessive stimuli by lectin-like substances. These observations suggest that the increase in the protein content of lymphocytes is stimulated by a plasma factor present in patients with cystic fibrosis and in carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene. These observations, plus those of Freed and Buckley, might suggest that cystic fibrosis is a disease involving a plasma factor with lectin or Con A-like activity which stimulates the secretion of mucus and increases the enzyme content of circulating or cultured lymphocytes. - Professor Lieberman confuses cause with effect. If there is excessive mucus production in cystic fibrosis we suggest that this is because the secretion is so difficult to remove from the mucosal surface. Goblet cells and mucus glands become clogged with hyperviscid mucus which, not being removed, stimulates further mucus production. To deprive the patient of the mucotractive value of his dietary lectins would be a therapeutic mischief equivalent to prescribing a cough-suppresant for a productive cough.", "78146": "Cystic-fibrosis variants--or variations?

Enzyme activity increased as the transition from exponential growth to confluence occurred; sodium fluoride-stimulated activity more markedly displayed this relationship than basal cyclase activity. The in vitro addition of spermine (1 X 10(-6) to 2 X 10(-3) M) to membrane preparations caused inhibition of basal and sodium fluoride- stimulated enzyme activity, with 50% inhibition of basal activity occurring at 10(-6) M spermine. Spermidine (10(-4) M) caused 15--25% inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. The increase in fibroblast adenylate cyclase activity during the transition from exponential growth was comparable in cells obtained from cystic fibrosis patients and control subjects.

TIME-FACTORS.The chronically reserpinized rat has been proposed as an animal model for cystic fibrosis on the basis of morphologic and secretory alterations in the submaxillary gland and of abnormalities in pulmonary secretions. In this investigation, the volume and composition of pancreatic juice from reserpine treated rats (0.5 mg/kg/day) have been compared to those of untreated controls after stimulation with purified cholecystokinin (0.1 microgram/kg body weight) and with crude and purified preparations of secretin (6 microns/100 g body weight) infused iv for 30-min periods. The results demonstrate that the treated animals secreted a significantly lower volume of pancreatic juice after stimulation with these secretagogues. Flow rates were also significantly reduced after stimulation with cholecystokinin and crude secretin. Protein and amylase outputs in response to cholecystokinin were smaller than in control animals after unrestritced feedings, but greater after a 24-hr fast. Total bicarbonate output was also reduced after stimulation with either crude or purified secretin and the normal excretion patterns for bicarbonate and chloride were either absent of reversed in the secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice of the treated animals. Whole pancreas homogenates from the treated animals showed significant increases in Ca++ and protein content. These results indicate that chronic administration of reserpine alters the secretion of water, protein, and bicarbonate from the rat pancreas and that it affects several of the exocrine glands involved in cystic fibrosis. These findings lend support to the concept of an animal model for the human disease. The chronic administration of reserpine to rats has been shown to induce alterations in salivary and pulmonary secretions which resemble those seen in patients with cystic fibrosis. The concept of an animal model has been proposed on the basis of these observations. The pancreas is another exocrine gland prominently involved in cystic fibrosis and if it can be demonstrated that reserpine administration also induces alterations in pancreatic secretion, the concept of the animal model would be strengthened considerably.", "78176": "Gillard-B-K.

SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-P-H-S.Alpha-amylase activity and protein concentration of cystic fibrosis (CF), obligate heterozygote (H), and normal (N) saliva have been evaluated with respect to genotype, age, sex and clinical status. \"Factors\" present in CF saliva had no detectable effect on salivary amylase activity under reaction conditions optimized for both competitive and noncompetitive inhibition. Tris [tris-(hydoxy-methyl)aminomethane] inhibited amylase activity with a Ki = 59 plus or minus 10 mM, but CF \"factors\" had no detectable effect on either substrate or Tris binding to alpha-amylase. Alpha-amylase concentrationand protein content of CF saliva had bimodal distributions. Thirty-six percent of the CF patients were found to be amylase hypersecretors, with amylase concentration 3 or more SD above the N mean. Amylase hypersecretion was marginally correlated with both genetic factors (with parent values, P = 0.075) and clinical status (with Scwachman scores, P = 0.068). All the hypersecretors were in the 14-24 year age group. Amylase concentration for this age was significant higher in CF samples (mean plus or minus SD), 82 plus or minus 37 starch units/ml (n = 12), than in N samples, 33 plus or minus 17 starch unites/ml (n = 13), as measured by the Student t-test (P < 0.001). Salivary protein content of 14- to 24-year-old CF males was elevated compared to all other groups [1.57 plus or minus 0.76 (n = 5) vs. 0.63 plus or minus 0.47 (n = 20); Student t-test, P < 0.005]. Mean specific activity of male saliva dropped sharply as age increased from 10-15 years, from over 200 to less than 75 starch units/mg protein. Mean normal female specific activity values were essentially constant [97 plus or minus 50 (n = 18) starch units/mg protein] from 5-30 years of age. CF male specific activity values decreased similarly to the N male values from preadolescence to adolescence, but the mean CF female values peaked later, at 17 years, with a maximum of 171 plus or minus 58 (n = 4). This is significantly higher than all the other groups in the 16- to 20-year age range: 63 plus or minus 30 (n = 9), P < 0.005. These data emphasize the need for age- and sex-matched controls in all studies of salivary composition. We were unable to detect any effect of a salivary CF factor on the enzymatic activity of alpha-amylase. Hypersecretion of salivary alpha-amylase was observed in 36% of CF patients. This may reflect alterations in secretory function basic to CF, or be secondary to the disease process and result from decreased secretion from the mucous salivary glands or deterioration of pancreatic function.", "78177": "Bogart-B-I.

The patients with Shwachman's syndrome had significantly lower total serum amylase than the three other patient groups. Only the patients with Shwachman's syndrome demonstrated a significant postprandial rise in activity. Only the salivary isoenzyme was detected in patients with Shwachman's syndrome or CF and apparently absent pancreatic function, whereas CF patients without steatorrhea had both salivary and pancreatic isoenzymes. These results demonstrate that patients with CF have an increase in circulating salivary amylase isoenzyme whereas patients with Shwachman's syndrome do not. The increase probably reflects an autonomic hyperstimulation of salivary secretion which is primary to CF, and unrelated to the state of pancreatic activity.", "78180": "Katz-S.Calcium and sodium transport processes in patients with cystic fibrosis.

In contrast, the Mg2+-ATPase activity of erythrocyte membranes from CF patients was unchanged compared to the control subjects. No difference in the Na+,K+-ATPase activity in erythrocyte membranes from CF patients compared to control patients could be observed. This indicates that the Ca2+-ATPase activity noted in CF erythrocytes is not part of a generalized membrane or membrane-bound enzyme alteration.

Granulocytes from six normal persons and nine CF patients also had the same basal and prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP, but isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP was decreased (P < 0.05) in the CF samples. These results clearly demonstrate a difference between normal and CF leukocytes in cAMP response to beta-adrenergic stimulation.

The progression in airway obstruction was measured by change in serial measurements of maximal midexpiratory flow (MMEF), from which a regression equation of MMEF against time was obtained for each individual. Changes in MMEF value with or without therapy were compared in patients matched for severity of disease as indicated by initial MMEF values. For the group as a whole no differences were found in the progression of the airway obstruction whether the patients received mist tent therapy or not.

We now show that CF fibroblasts also exhibit greatly increased resistance to the cytotoxic effects of exogenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP), as well as to isoproterenol and theophylline, drugs which are known to increase endogenous levels of cAMP. CF cells were also shown to have normal amounts of (3H)cAMP binding to protein kinase as well as normal amounts of cAMP- stimulated protein kinase activity. Phosphodiesterase in CF cells was also found to be stimulated by cAMP to the same degree as in normal cells. These findings suggest that there is no detectable protein kinase deficiency in CF cells. cf cells thus appear to be unlike some cAMP-resistant mutants described by others which are defective in protein kinase activity and cAMP regulation of phosphodiesterase levels. The cross-resistance of CF fibroblasts to ouabain, steroid hormones, and cAMP may provide a unique opportunity to study the biochemical events involved in the metabolism of these drugs as well as the basic biochemical defect in a common human genetic disease.", "78194": "Carpentieri-U.

It is generally agreed that the mucin gel consists of polyanionic glycoproteins and a hitherto unidentified poly cationic cross-linking protein. It is proposed that larger amounts of polycations increase viscosity and, in excess, cause mucus to become a polycation. As these compounds are known to inhibit the ductal reabsorption of sodium, the two principal aspects of the pathology of CF can be related to the same mechanism.

The effect on sputum viscosity of the addition of DNA in vitro has also been studied. Whereas between mucoid, mucopurulent, and purulent macroscopic types a significant difference in total DNA and dry weight yield has been found, viscosity was not significantly correlated with purulence. Similarly, the concentration of either cells or fibres correlated significantly with total DNA but not with viscosity. The in vitro addition of DNA to sputum caused a significant increase in its viscosity, and reasons for the differences between the iv vivo and in vitro effect are discussed.

A common symptom of these diseases regardless of their etiology, character, klinical manifestation and morphological findings is hypersecretion of bronchial sputum. Tracheobronchial mucus is produced by mucous bronchial glands and goblet cells. This mucus represents at physiological condition about 5 micrometer thick cover on mucous of nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi up to terminal bronchioles. Protective function of mucus cover resposes in mechanical and humoral barrier and also in removing the inhaled particles and their transport to the upper part of the respiratory system. In spite of the fact, that bronchial secretion has an important role in protective mechanism and in thermal and water exchange of respiratory tract, this secretion is not sufficiently scrutinized mainly of children yet.", "79001": "Jensen-O.'Rusters'.

In 15 patients the middle ear pressure was lower than--100 mmH2O, indicating tubal occlusion, and in 7 patients the impedance minimum was lacking, indicating an accumulation of mucus. These 7 patients (6%) had secretory otitis media. Nasal polyps were or had been present in 32%. There was no correlation between nasal polyps and tubal occlusion or secretory otitis.

INFANT.Although the mechanism proposed by Dr Katznelson for the increased intracranial pressure observed in three infants with cystic fibrosis cannot be discounted, another explanation is possible. It has been reported previously that a deficiency of vitamin A may predispose to development of increased intracranial pressure and bulging fontanelles in cystic fibrosis. Finally, it is somewhat difficult to understand how such marked airway obstruction which produced increased intracranial pressure could occur with preservation of arterial blood gases. - Vitamin A and carotene blood levels were not determined in our cases and therefore obviously this possibility cannot be excluded, at least in two of the cases. Dr Taussig's suggestion that the improvement in the intracranial pressure in our cases was really the result of the \"unknowing\" associated administration of vitamin A and not to the improvements in the pulmonary status, as I proposed, fails to note the clinical observation that there had been a \"rise and fall\" in the bulge of the fontanel concomitantly with the increase and decrease of respiratory obstruction signs. As to the question of the severity of airway obstruction, the clinical reversible picture of severe tachypnea with poor air entry, clear lung fields on X-ray with overdistended lungs and small heart appear most suggestive of airway obstruction in C.F.", "79006": "Schiotz-P-O.

Seven were off antibiotics, ten on oral cloxacillin, and six on i.v. triple therapy (cloxacillin, gentamycin, and carbenicillin) for at least 2 weeks. Controls had lower concentrations (milligrams per gram dry stool) of both fat (P < 0.005) and vile acids (P < 0.025) than CF children off antibiotics.

Concomitantly, there was reduced deconjugation of bile acids (P < 0.01) and formation of secondary bile acids (P < 0.005).

SPUTUM: mi.Cystic fibrosis is now the most common cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and of pancreatic insufficiency in the first three decades of life in the United States. In this report we describe 75 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 18 to 47 years and review another 232 cases reported in the literature. All of these 307 patients had elevated sweat chloride and sodium levels, which proved excellent discriminants for cystic fibrosis even in patients in the older age group. COPD, present in 97 per cent, was the major cause of morbidity and mortality, and differed from COPD of other etiologies. The progressive downhill course in these patients was punctuated by recurrent symptomatic exacerbations of chronic bacterial bronchitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphyloccocus aureus, and terminated in pulmonary insufficiency, cor pulmonale and death. COPD was complicated by minor hemoptysis in 60 per cent, massive hemoptysis in 7 per cent and pneumothorax in 16 per cent, problems rare in children. Sinusitis was present in all those examined roentgenographically, and 48 per cent had nasal polyposis. Pancreatic insufficiency was present in 95 per cent of the patients, but in contrast to younger patients it was seldom symptomatic although steatorrhea and azotorrhea were still massive. Intussusception and meconium ileus equivalent (fecal accumulation) are frequent in adults (21 per cent) but rare in children, and they require immediate diagnostic and therapeutic intervention with enemas of diatrizoate sodium. Glycosuria, biliary cirrhosis, cholelithiasis and aspermia were among other complications. Height and weight were usually within the lower limits of normal, but 17 per cent of the men were above 180 cm in height and 7 per cent were overweight. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis, because older patients with cystic fibrosis may look quite well.", "79021": "Fisher-N-L.Genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis [letter].Am-J-Obstet-Gynecol. 1979 Nov 1. 135(5).

Cystic fibrosis is a recessive disorder for which prenatal diagnosis and heterozygote detection are not yet possible.

In cystic fibrosis infants, with or without meconium ileus, the ration is 0.5 at 35 weeks PCA anddecreases linearly to 0.3 at 52 weeks PCA. The volume of acinar and duct lumens is greater in CF than control infants but is independent of age or acinar volume. The development of the exocrine pancreas in infants with CF with and without meconium ileus diverges from the normal pattern: There is consistent lack of exocrine tissue before or a full-term birth, which persists throghout the age range of this study.

VITAL-CAPACITY.To investigate the contribution of vagal tone to the obstructive airway disease in cystic fibrosis, we evaluated the pulmonary function response to administration of 0.1 mg of atropine sulfate per kg of body weight, 0.05 mg of isoproterenol hydrochloride per kg of body weight, or isotonic saline (control solution) administered by nebulization on 3 different days to each of 10 patients with cystic fibrosis in a single blind study. The doses of atropine sulfate and isoproterenol hydrochloride were based on published dose-response characteristics of the drugs. Each day, thoracic gas volume and airway resistance were measured in a volume displacement body plethysmograph, and maximal expiratory flow-volume curves were performed before and at 15, 30, and 60 min after the inhalation. After inhalation of saline, group mean values for all pulmonary functions indicated greater airway obstruction at 15, 30, and 60 min when compared to pretreatment values. After inhalation of isoproterenol and atropine, significant improvement (P < 0.05) was noted in maximal expiratory flows at 60 per cent of total lung capacity, specific airway conductance, thoracic gas volume, and residual volume. Inhalation of atropine also significantly improved maximal expiratory flow at 25 per cent of vital capacity. Isoproterenol increased the mean flows by 8 to 46 per cent above baseline, and decreased thoracic gas volume and residual volume by 11 to 16 per cent with the maximal response at 15 or 30 min. Atropine increased mean flows by 15 to 77 per cent and decreased thoracic gas volume and residual volume by 16 to 25 per cent with the maximal effect at 30 to 60 min. The mean response to atropine, expressed as a percentage of baseline, was always greater than or equal to that for isoproterenol. We conclude that vagal tone, which may reflect increased irritant receptor activity, contributes to the obstructive pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis. Inhalation of atropine sulfate will decrease the pulmonary function abnormality, but side effects prohibit its clinical usefulness.", "79024": "Reid-L-M.The pulmonary circulation: remodeling in growth and disease.

Forced vital capacity (FVC) was significantly increased 45 min after drainage for the combining group. Flows at high lung volumes were different for the 2 subgroups. Subjects with cystic fibrosis demonstrated a significant increase in peak expiratory flow rates 45 min after drainage and an increase in forced expiratory volume in one sec at all time intervals. The subjects with chronic bronchitis had a decreased peak expiratory flow rate 5 min after drainage, but by 45 min, it had returned to baseline. There was no significant change in one-sec forced expiratory volume at any time interval for the chronic bronchitis subgroup. Changes in flows at low lung volumes were similar for the 2 subgroups. Forty-five min after drainage there was an increase in flow rates near 50 per cent of FVC. Flows near 25 per cent of FVC were increased 15 and 45 min after drainage.

The incidence of false- positive results was about 5 per 1000 specimens in either test. This could be reduced by 90% by determining the ratio of albumin : alpha-1- trypsin inhibitor (a ratio below 2.0 being considered as a negative result), and it could be reduced to zero by determining the ratio in subsequent faecal specimens. Three of 12 meconium specimens from infants with proved CF gave false-negative results in all 3 tests. The other 9 specimens had greater than 100 mg albumin/g dry weight and albumin: alpha-1-trypsin inhibitor ratios of greater than 3.0; in subsequent faecal specimens the ratios were over 4.0. 176 meconium specimens from elsewhere in the UK were examined and these included 23 from infants who were subsequently proved to have CF. Six of these 23 CF specimens gave false-negative results, the other 17 being strongly positive.

In adult volunteers and cadavers a maximum intrathoracic pressure could be achieved by a critical frequency of mechanical percussion which was higher than that reached by physiotherapists and parents. Consequently the percussor was redesigned to operate at this optimum frequency. It was then discovered that if the percussor was pressed firmly enough against the chest, this maximum intrathoracic pressure could be indicated by quivering of the voice. In a continuing study of intrathoracic pressures obtained mechanically and manually the Salford percussor's produced higher pressures than the physiotherapists' and maintained them constantly, while the physiotherapists' efforts and results varied from one to another. Hospital and domiciliary use of the percussor have shown it to help in the first stage of the physiotherapy routine for patients with cystic fibrosis. The percussor should enable adolescents and adults to treat themselves and encourage twice-daily and more effective chest treatments.

Our observations provide an entirely new interpretation for the apparent changes occurring in lymphocytic enzymes during culture of lymphocytes with mitogens, and suggest that a serum factor is present in cystic fibrosis serum that mimics mitogens in this regard. Lymphocytic acid-hydrolases and total protein are present in higher concentrations in lymphocytes cultured for 48 hours without mitogen when CF homozygous or heterozygous serum is present in the culture media. This appears to result from a CF serum factor that has mitogen-like activity and prevents loss of cell protein during culture. Responsiveness of the cellular proteins to mitogens is blunted when CF serum is present in the culture media, either because the cell proteins are already maximally stimulated by the CF serum factor, or the factor blocks or modifies the action of mitogens on lymphocyte protein content. This phenomenon is useful for detection of CF heterozygosity, and appears to reflect the genetic abnormality causing cystic fibrosis.", "79065": "Weng-T-R. Spence-J-A. Polgar-G.

A tetrapolar electrode system was used because of its ability to detect local baseline and pulsatile impedance changes, minimal electrode- tissue impedance interference, and uniform current distribution. Studies performed on 4 children 4 to 15 years old with various pulmonary diseases are presented. The information obtained on their regional ventilation and pulsatile perfusion by EIP was found to agree closely with pulmonary ventilation and perfusion scans. In one case, EIP detected pulsatile perfusion abnormalities which were not apparent in the non-pulsatile perfusion scan but were demonstrated by cineangiography. It is concluded that tetrapolar EIP can provide safe, reliable regional information about ventilation and perfusion in diseased lungs, and because of its atraumatic approach, is technically most suitable for use in children.", "79066": "Keens-T-G.

PULMONARY-CIRCULATION.To explain why the single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (Dsb) was, on the average, elevated in 163 asthmatic subjects and 175 patients with cystic fibrosis, we simulated this elevation in ten normal subjects by having them perform the test for Dsb through an inspiratory obstruction. This resulted in an 18 percent increase in Dsb corrected for pulmonary volume. Inhalation of a bronchodilator drug was associated with relief of obstruction and a fall in the corrected Dsb in 31 asthmatic subjects but did not change either the obstruction or the corrected Dsb in 17 patients with cystic fibrosis. We suggest that elevated Dsb in asthma and cystic fibrosis is partly due to maximal inspiration against obstructed airways. This requires abnormally negative intrathoracic pressures, increasing the pulmonary capillary blood volume, and, thereby, increasing the Dsb.", "79067": "Hirschfeld-S-S. Fleming-D-G. Doershuk-C.

Echographic recording of the pulmonary and aortic valve echogram permitted measurement of the phases of right and left ventricular systole. The ratio of the LV preejection period/LV ejection time (LPEP/LVET) and shortening of the LV internal dimension %SID was employed to reflect LV function, while RV preejection period/RV ejection time (RPEP/RVET) has excellent correlation with pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. RPEP/RVET and two other echographic measurements, right ventricular wall (RVW) and internal dimension (RVD) were compared with pulmonary function tests and clinical scores. RPEP/RVET correlated well with percent vital capacity(%VC), r = -0.73, percent residual volume (%RVol) r = +0.72, and clinical score, r = -0.77. Multilinear regression of RPEP/RVET, RVD, and RVW improved correlation for %VC (r = -0.80), %RVol, r = +0.82, and clinical score, r = -0.84. Patients in overt right heart failure exhibited elevated RPEP/RVET (mean = 0.48) when compared to patients not in right heart failure (mean = .33).

SKIN-TESTS.Ten of fifteen cystic fibrosis children with positive skin prick tests to common antigens gave an immediate bronchial reaction to the antigen inhaled, five of them also gave a late reaction; however only one gave a history of asthma. The antigen most commonly eliciting a positive skin reaction in cystic fibrosis patients is Aspergillus fumigatus. In six children tested to this antigen the bronchial response varied, two were negative, one gave an immediate reaction and three gave a dual (immediate and late) reaction. None of the children showed the characteristic pattern of response to exercise seen in asthmatic patients, an initial rise in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate followed by a fall of greater than 14% below the resting level. Two patients showed an abnormal rise in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate during exercise, a pattern described previously in cystic fibrosis. The results suggest that bronchial allergy, immediate or late does completely explain susceptibility to asthma, and that other factors including perhaps the type of bronchial reactivity shown by bronchoconstriction after exercise may be required. However the majority of the children tested had bronchial allergy and anti- allergy therapy such as inhaled sodium cromoglycate may have a place in the management of selected patients with cystic fibrosis.", "79069": "Ganier-M.

Deficient protease activity, assayed by 4-methylumbelliferyl guanidinobenzoate, an active site titrant of serine proteases, has been reported in plasma and cultivated skin fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis. Another prenatal diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis involves the observed resistance of patients' skin fibroblasts to dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) toxicity, in comparison to normal fibroblasts. Specific induction of alkaline phosphatase with Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein, isoproterenol and theophylline has been recorded in skin-derived fibroblasts from affected patients.", "79089": "MacLeod-S-M.Clinical pharmacology in a paediatric hospital.Dimens-Health-Serv. 1979 May. 56(5).

The assay is modified by carrying out the reaction in the presence and absence of benzamidine, a competitive inhibitor of trypsin-like proteases. The parameters of the assay are described in detail. Using this assay, our earlier demonstration of a deficiency of protease activity in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis is confirmed. The activity, corrected for the nonspecific hydrolysis of 4- methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate by benzamidine, is expressed as nanomoles of 4-methylumbelliferone released per milliliter plasma. Under standard conditions, the activity in plasma activated with chloroform-ellagic acid was 127.2 +/- 23.1 in 7 controls, 70.4 +/- 11.7 in 11 obligate heterozygotes, and 48.7 +/- 16.6 in 12 patients with cystic fibrosis.

UNITED-STATES.Three main reasons have been advanced for the degree of ignorance and confusion surrounding epidemiologic measures of the incidence and prevalence of Cystic Fibrosis. (CF) Relatively recent recognition of CF as a specific disease entity. Wide range of clinical manifestations, presentation as a multisystem disease, and great natural variation in the severity of involvement of various organs. Past difficulty in establishing a diagnosis based on sound laboratory evidence, this being largely due to the lack of a screening test that had gained wide acceptance among diagnosticians, and inaccuracies in the performance and interpretation of the sweat test. In addition to these factors, there are a number of methodological deficiencies and questionable assumptions in several of the papers that have here been reviewed. It may be noteworthy that the two sets of authors whose research design most closely matched being aimed at providing multiple ascertainment of cases and cross-checks of validity, have arrived at nearly the same estimated incidence of this particular disorder (1/3700 and 1/3800 respectively). The issue of selection and diagnostic criteria is one that has important implications for epidemiologic studies of cystic fibrosis. Particularly in a disease like CF, where the spectrum of clinical manifestations and severity of involvement is so broad, estimates of incidence will vary according to the criteria by which cases are ascertained and included. A greater degree of uniformity in standards than has been employed in previous studies is necessary before comparisons can meaningfully be made. There are good grounds for regarding most estimates of CF incidence to be minimum confirmed figures, and this is particularly so where the research design ensures that multiple ascertainments of the same case will be identifiable. Higher estimates are made where several sources of error (respondent bias, generalization of hospital data to the wider population, multiple ascertainments of the same patient) are not recognised.", "79104": "Kerner-J.

There was an unexpectedly high incidence (7/16) of incomplete mourning, i.e., maintenance of the child's room as a shrine or weekly grave visit for more than six months. Siblings had less difficulty in adjusting to the loss than that reported for the siblings of leukemic children.

After incubation cells were lysed, and hemoglobins were separated by isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide slab gels and quantitated by microdensitometry. HbAic increased with time, glucose concentrations (5-500 mM) and incubation temperature (4 degrees-37 degrees C). Low temperatures allowed prolonged incubations with minimal hemolysis. At 4 degrees C HbAic increased linearly with time for 6 wk; after incubation at the highest glucose concentration, HbAic comprised 50% of total hemoglobin. Insulin (1 and 0.1 mU/ml) did not affect HbAic synthesis in vitro. In addition to glucose, galactose and mannose, but not fructose, served as precursors to HbAic. A good substrate for hexokinase (2-deoxy-glucose) and a poor hexokinase substrate (3-O-methyl-glucose), were better precursors for HbAic synthesis than glucose, suggesting that enzymatic phosphorylation of glucose is not required for HbAic synthesis. Autoradiography after erythrocyte incubation with 32P-phosphate showed incorporation of radioactivity into HbAia1 and HbAia2, but not HbAib, Aic, or A. Acetylated HbA, generated during incubation with acetylsalicylate, migrated anodal to HbAic and clearly separated from it. Erythrocytes from patients with insulinopenic diabetes mellitus synthesized HbAic at the same rate as controls when incubated with identical glucose concentrations. Likewise, the rate of HbAic synthesis by erythrocytes from patients with cystic fibrosis and congenital spherocytosis paralleled controls. When erythrocytes from cord blood and from HbC and sickle cell anemia patients were incubated with elevated concentrations of glucose, fetal Hb, HbC, and sickle Hb decreased whereas hemoglobins focusing at isoelectric points near those expected for the corresponding glycosylated derivatives appeared in proportionately increased amounts.", "79106": "Seale-T-W.

SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-P-H-S.A phenotypic characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from single sputum samples of 21 typical cystic fibrosis patients indicated a high frequency of heterogeneity among isolates on the basis of differences in antibiotic resistance, colony morphology, pigmentation, and serotype. Two or more isolates with different but stable susceptibilities to carnecillin, gentamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim were detected in 38% of the sputa. Differences generally were independent of the mucoid state of the strain. O- antigen group determination with the Difco typing set showed that two or more serologically distinct strains were present in 10/21 sputum specimens. Nonmucoid derivatives of mucoid isolates almost always retained both the antibiotic susceptibilities and serotype of their parent strain. These data suggest that cystic fibrosis patients may be cocolonized/coinfected by difference strains of P. aeruginosa more frequently than generally believed. Alternatively, phenotypically distinct strains from a single patient might arise as phenotypic dissociants from a single infecting strain. Because of the frequency and multiplicity of phenotypically distinct P. aeruginosa isolates which we obtained from our cystic fibrosis patients, it is important to select multiple isolates from sputum cultures for antimicrobial susceptibility testing so as to assess adequately the susceptibility of this organism to antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis. We recommend that several colonies of each distinguishable colony type of P. aeruginosa be pooled for the antibiogram.", "79107": "Lloyd-J-K.Dietary problems associated with the care of chronically sick children.J-Hum-Nutr. 1979 Apr. 33(2).

In resistant strains, amikacin is indicated in addition. Carbenicillin, ticarcillin, carfenicillin or azocillin should never be given alone but in combination with some of the above preparations. Other drugs, such as chloramphenicol, tetracycline or streptomycin, though effective in vitro, should be avoided. Chemotherapy may be complemented by passive immunization either with hyperimmune specific gama globulin or hyperimmune plasma. A programmatic item of combined treatment is active immunization, especially with toxoid vaccine. Chronic processes are not, perhaps with the exception of urinary infections, suitable for antibiotic therapy. For this reason effective polyvalent vaccines should be developed from appropriate strains. It is now certain that in infections caused by mucous strains (most frequently encountered in cystic fibrosis) the vaccine should be prepared from these strains, since they have distinct functional and antigenic characteristics.

Patients from whom P. aeruginosa was never or only occasionally isolated were in better clinical condition than the chronically infected patients. Isolates were classified into six morphologic varieties: classic, rough, mucoid, gelatinous, dwarf, and enterobacter. Most patients had two or more of these varieties. Such multiple varieties from the same individual were of the same serotype but often differed in antibiotic susceptibility as determined by both the disk and the minimal inhibitory concentration methods. These differences were apparent when mucoid strains were compared with nonmucoid strains and when nonmucoid strains were compared with one another.

The lack of effective oral antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa precludes either systemic treatment or suppression, in an outpatient setting, of the chronic pseudomonas bronchitis typically seen in CF patients. Because of the central role of infection, and particularly pseudomonas infection, in the sequence of events that leads to respiratory failure and death in CF, currently available information regarding the pathogenesis of infections caused by P. aeruginosa was emphasized and discussed at a workshop on infections in patients with CF, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., on January 9 and 10, 1979.", "79112": "Dreisin-R-B.

SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-P-H-S.Although N-acetyl-L-cysteine (Mucomyst) is an effective mycolytic, numerous investigations have failed to demonstrate a consistent improvement in pulmonary mechanics following its use. In order to determine whether its beneficial mucolytic activity might be counterbalanced by a deleterious direct effect on cilia, we studied its effect on the activity of ciliated epithelium in the ferret tracheal organ culture system. N-acetyl-L-cysteine consistently caused progressive time-dependent ciliostasis at concentrations clinically employed, with complete ciliary paralysis within 8 hr. The effect was only partially reversed by the removal of the drug. Control preparations retained full ciliary activity for 3 to 12 weeks. In order to determine the active site on the N-acetyl-L- cysteine molecule, we investigated the ciliostatic effects of five of its chemical analogs. Isomolar N-acetyl-L-alanine was not ciliostatic, indicating the necessity of a sulfhydryl group for activity. Ciliostasis was independent of isomeric structure, acetylation, and chain length, as evidenced by the similar ciliostatic effects of L-cysteine, D-cysteine, 2-mercaptoethylamine, and N-acetyl-L-homocysteine. We conclude that N-acetyl-L-cysteine induces partially reversible ciliostasis of tracheal epithelium via its sulfhydryl group; prolonged use of this drug may impair mucociliary clearance.", "79113": "Bria-W-F.

Because of certain problems with baseline measurements and withholding of medication, it seems that the conclusion of Mitchell et al may not be well supported. - We felt justified in studying those patients with a low baseline FEV (forced expiratory volume in one second), since a subject's bronchial response to methacholine remains stable even if these is moderate fluctuation both in initial specific airway conductance and in the severity of the disease. We feel that withholding the drug for a longer period would not have affected the comparisons. Although there might be a common underlying mechanism in bronchial hyperreactivity in asthma and cystic fibrosis, our data showed a number of differences between the two groups of patients.

While itself a purine chain, polyadenylic acid added to pancreatic extracts may prevent the hydrolysis of mixed-base ribonucleic acid to uric acid precursors, while allowing the beneficial effects of the other pancreatic enzymes to prevail. - A number of weaknesses to the proposal bears stressing before we begin giving polyadenylic acid to our patients. No one knows whether nucleic acids are malabsorbed in cystic fibrosis. If polyadenylic acid produces only 70% inhibition of pancreatic ribonucleases at a one-to-one ratio of substrate and inhibitor, a relatively enormous amount of polyadenylic acid would have to be fed with the pancreatic extracts. If there were an intestinal enzyme capable of cleaving polyadenylic acid, the treatment would add to, not subtract from, the purine load.

HYDROGEN-ION-CONCENTRATION. IN-VITRO. MEMBRANE-POTENTIALS: de.The total active transport of Cl ions across the frog's gastric mucosa can be considered as: net Cl- flux (serosa to mucosa) = H+ + SSC (short-circuit current), all terms expressed as micromole cm-2 hr-1. The net chloride flux (Hogben, 1955; Durbin & Heinz, 1958) may be divided into two fractions: an acidic one which is equivalent to the acid secreted and an electromotive one which accounts for the gastric electromotive force. The changes in SCC can accordingly be used as a partial index to the activity of the chloride pump. Experiments were designed to investigate the effects of histamine, metiamide (H2 receptor antagonist), cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF plasma on the above parameters using the frog's isolated gastric mucosa. The SCC and the resistance of the mucosal preparation is measured by means of an automatic SCC apparatus (de Jesus, 1977). The H ion secretion is measured by pH meter. Results obtained (expressed as mean change (delta) plus or minus S.E. of mean) for histamine (10-4 M) (n = 10) show an initial increase of the SCC by 36.94 plus or minus 2.95 microA cm-2 and a parallel small increase in H+ output by 0.045 plus or minus 0.003 micromole cm-2 hr-1. This initial increase in SCC is followed by a drop to a steady-state level of 23.62 plus or minus 2.23 microA cm-2 and also by a large increase in H+ secretion 2.26 plus or minus 0.22 micromole cm-2 hr-1. These results support the work of Rehm (1961) in that histamine has an effect first on the Cl- pump and then on the H+ secretion. Metiamide (10-4 M) (n = 12) caused a drop in the SCC by 20.16 plus or minus 2.32 microA cm-2 and also reduced the acid secretion by 2.21 plus or minus 0.14 micromole cm-2 hr-1, thus suggesting an effect on the Cl- pump as well as on the H+ secretion. Significant differences are shown (P < 0.001) between CF and non-CF plasma results. The CF plasma (n = 8) increased the SCC by 17.25 plus or minus 2.94 microA cm-2 and H+ secretion by 2.38 plus or minus 0.43 micromole cm-2 hr-1. Non-CF plasma caused a slight increase in SCC by 5.17 plus or minus 1.1 microA cm-2 and had little effect on the H+ secretion, 0.34 plus or minus 0.01 micromole cm-2 hr-1 (n = 8). The effect of the CF plasma on the Cl- and H+ mechanism is of interest since in cystic fibrosis there is an abnormal increase of Cl- and Na+ in the sweat of patients (di Sant Agnese, Darling, Perera & She, 1953).", "79141": "Bond-C-E.

SODIUM: ph.Schulz (1969) showed that the raised Na concentration in the sweat of children suffering from cystic fibrosis was due to a defect in Na reabsorption in the duct epithelium, but somewhat surprisingly the transepithelial potential difference (p.d.) is the same as that in normal controls. Na transport is also reduced in the chronically ligated salivary duct of the rabbit submandibular gland (Fraser & Smaje, 1978), and because p.d. is unaffected, the ligated gland may be a useful model of this aspect of cystic fibrosis. Here we would like to report a further similarity to cystic fibrosis; duct ligation leads to goblet cell hyperplasia which also occurs in the salivary glands in cystic fibrosis (Lev & Spicer, 1965). Sections of the salivary duct 6 microm thick were taken at 60 microm intervals from ducts which had been ligated for between 1 and 5 weeks and from their contralateral controls following fixation by immersion. Ligation resulted in an increase in luminal diameter by distension of the previously convoluted epithelium, but there was no significant change in epithelial surface area. The number of cell layers appeared to have increased however and there was a proliferation of goblet cells. The mucus in these cells was stained by alcian blue at pH 1 indicating the presence of sulphomucin. The mean goblet cell density rose from 7.62 plus or minus 4.73 mm-2 (mean plus or minus S.E. of the mean, n = 6) in controls to 114 plus or minus 49.6 in ligated ducts. The transepithelial Na flux in the same ducts was reduced from 10.1 plus or minus 0.79 n-mole cm-2 sec-1 to 1.6 plus or minus 0.84 while p.d. remained at -22 mV, similar to those results previously reported.

PREGNANCY.For several reasons the supernatant fraction of amniotic fluid is not often used in the prenatal detection of inborn errors of metabolism. In early pregnancy the bulk of the protein in amniotic fluid is derived from the maternal circulation, and this can obscure the more critical contribution from the fetus needed for prenatal diagnosis. 10 - 30% of amniotic fluids are significantly contaminated with maternal blood, and if the enzyme in question is present in this blood (as 4-methylumbelliferyl guanidinobenzoate [MUGB] protease is), this can further distort diagnostic conclusions. For this reason we have examined the variation of MUGB protease in a heterogenous collection of amniotic fluids. No significant differences in titre between individual weeks in the second trimester were observed. A further 104 second-trimester amniotic fluids from pregnancies with abnormal outcome were also investigated. The means of the four groups were not significantly different from that of the normals and the ranges were very similar.

HYDROGEN-ION-CONCENTRATION.Dr Hosli and Esther Vogt base their diagnosis of heterozygotes and homozygotes for cystic fibrosis on the thermal stability in plasma or extracellular fluids of alpha-mannosidase and/or phosphatase activity assayed at pH 5.4. The activity of alpha-mannosidase in plasma and this pH is a composite one: both acidic alpha-mannosidase, which has a pH optimum of 4.25 and intermediate alpha-mannosidase, which has a pH optimum of 5.6 - 6.0, will contribute to the activity measured at pH 5.4. These two forms of alpha-mannosidase are structurally and genetically distinct and have different kinetics and thermostabilities. Therefore the total alpha-mannosidase activity at pH 5.4 and the physicochemical properties of this activity will depend upon the relative proportions of the two types of alpha-mannosidase in the sample. The proportions of the two forms vary widely in normal plasma, especially in plasma from children. Although the data of Hosli and Vogt suggest that the total alpha-mannosidase at pH 5.4 does not differ significantly between controls, CF heterozygotes and CF homozygotes, they do not show whether the proportions of acidic and intermediate alpha-mannosidase have changed. An increase in the proportion of the thermolabile intermediate alpha-mannosidase in CF would be manifested as a decreased thermostability of alpha-mannosidase at pH 5.4. Alternatively a mutation in the normally stable acidic alpha-mannosidase leading to a less stable form would also be reflected as a decreased stability in the activity at pH 5.4, especially if the proportion of acidic alpha-mannosidase was increased in CF.

Mice of the BALB/c inbred strain were injected subcutaneously with different doses of reserpine for 7 days; after, they were submitted to an infective aerosol containing Staphylococcus aureus in a nebulization chamber. With each pair of exposed animals, an individual value of the uncleared bacteria ratio (UBR) at 4 hours was obtained. Reserpinized animals showed a significant increase in UBR values when compared to control mice (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 depending on the doses), suggesting an impairment of the lung antibacterial defenses.

A decreased sialic acid content has been observed in cell surface glycoproteins on cystic fibrosis fibroblasts and in numerous soluble glycoprotein preparations from cystic fibrosis homozygotes. Sialic acid residues on cell surface glycoconjugates play an essential role in the binding and infectivity of myxoviruses and paramyxoviruses, including those causing pandemic influenza. It is suggested that increased resistance to these viruses conferred by similar but quantitatively smaller alterations in sialoglycoconjugate structure in cystic fibrosis heterozygotes may have provided a selective advantage to maintain the high frequency of the cystic fibrosis gene in Caucasian populations.", "79165": "Danes-B-S.

FIBROBLASTS: en. HUMAN.Lysosomal acid hydrolases and alkaline phosphatase cooperate in the intracellular digestion of natural polymers. A stimulus for the induction of these enzymes is the retention of any kind of polymer inside the cell. This stimulus is long-lasting and strong if polymers are intracellularly retained because of a lack of digestive enzymes. In previous papers it has been demonstrated that the alkaline phosphatase (AIP) induction with Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein discriminates between fibroblasts of CF homozygotes on the one hand and normals and CF carriers on the other hand, and a hypothesis has been proposed to explain these observations. As predicted, more efficient inducing mixtures have since been developed; these have been used in the present study. The first writer familiarized himself with ultramicrotechniques and then carried out double blind studies on 20 fibroblast cultures from French patients. These findings demonstrate the reproducibility of the AIP induction and of the methods used, and they particularly underline the importance of employing the present ultramicrotechniques for a successful AIP induction. It is likely that amniotic fluid cells behave like skin fibroblasts in this test; if this proves to be so, then the induction of alkaline phosphatase should provide a useful technique for the prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.", "79167": "Phelan-P-D.

However, we have not been able to show, in Adelaide, any change or induction in the level of ALP activity in CF-derived skin fibroblasts when grown in the presence of locally prepared THP under what appear to be identical cell culture conditions to those used by Hosli.

TIME-FACTORS.Chest physiotherapy is an important part of the treatment program of children with cystic fibrosis, but controlled studies of its effects are few. 27 children with cystic fibrosis, 20 being chronic sputum producers and 7 non-sputum producers, were studied in hospital with serial lung function tests on 3 consecutive days. On the 1st day physiotherapy was performed twice; on the 2nd day no physiotherapy was performed; on the 3rd day the two periods of physiotherapy were preceded by an inhaled bronchodilator (Rimiterol). Lung function tests included peak flow, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1.0) and residual volume to total lung capacity ratio, and were measured at the beginning of each day and at similar intervals throughout the 3 days. Sputum volume and cough frequency were noted on day 1 and day 3. Physiotherapy resulted in significant improvement of peak flow in the sputum producers. However, the FVC and FEV1.0, while improving after physiotherapy, also improved on the control day when no physiotherapy was performed. This suggests that physiotherapy may be effective in removing sputum from central large airways with resultant improvement in peak flow, but has little added effect on the more peripheral airways, whose airflow improves through the day with normal activity. No significant effect was shown in the non- sputum producers although there was a trend towards improvement in peak flow. A bronchodilator before physiotherapy may be beneficial in those patients who demonstrate significant reduction in airflow obstruction at formal testing of bronchodilator response, but may lessen the beneficial effects of physiotherapy in those without a positive response. The study illustrates the importance of examining difference methods of chest physiotherapy, to find ways of improving sputum clearance.", "79170": "Kerrebijn-K-F. Veentjer-M-A.

The question arose whether this clinical impression is supported by the finding of the thorax radiograph and the results of the lung functions tests and the blood gas measures at rest and on exercise. From the clinical point of view, there is a possibility to make a classification of severity in pulmonary aspects of this disease. Because of the large ranges of the score values a clear distinction of the severity could only be possible if large groups of patients were to be compared. For the interindividual comparison the cumulative evaluation of a clinical score, the chest radiograph and the lung function tests are indispensable.

Infants suffering from CF were given lactose-free diet until they reached the age of one year. The weight increased more rapidly than in CF patients given the traditional CF diet with low fat and high protein. Furthermore, it was not necessary to give increased amounts of calories to the infants given lactose-free diet, nor did they receive additional fat-soluble vitamins. ", "79175": "Konradova-V.

TISSUE-CULTURE.This review emphasizes some of the positive accomplishments of cystic fibrosis research, some of the puzzles and some of the recent developments that have promise. One of the major unresolved questions is the maintenance of this lethal gene at such a high frequency, perhaps because of a heterozygote advantage in the past, no longer operative at present. Nothing is known of the chromosomal localization of the trait; except that chromosomes are morphologically normal, that it is autosomal, not sex linked and that there is no correlation with blood groups or major HLA loci. One of the important achievements of the past many years is that we understand relatively well the pathogenesis of most clinical manifestations of CF. The as yet unknown inherited basic defect or metabolic error of CF gives rise to two main anomalies: the electrolyte defect in exocrine sweat glands and the 'mucous secretion' abnormality. While the results of tissue culture studies often have been conflicting and disparate, it does seem to be the consensus that the fibroblasts are affected by the basic metabolic error in some manner, and that they respond abnormally under different experimental circumstances. Virtually all investigators have found some anomalies in biologic fluids of CF, although using different approaches and methods. An abnormality in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which is so closely associated with the exocrine glands, has always been an attractive explanation for the generalized exocrinopathy of CF. The search for a genetic animal model for CF has led to interesting findings.", "79177": "Roscher-A. Wiesmann-U-N.

PROSTAGLANDINS-E: ph.Water, electrolyte and macromolecular secretion, which is affected in cystic fibrosis, is regulated by neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system stimulating the cells by binding to alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. Therefore, a genetic disturbance in cyclic 3'5'-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP) response could eventually explain some of the manifold expressions of labile biochemical changes observed in CF, specially in tissue culture. We further characterized beta-receptors in cultured fibroblasts of CF patients and normal controls and investigated isoproterenol and prostaglandin E1-mediated c-AMP response using defined culture conditions. No significant difference was found between the two phenotypes on basal c-AMP values. With the exception of one cell line, CF strains had 25 to 180% increased c-AMP content. This difference is highly significant (p < 0.0025). This statistically significant difference in response can neither be attributed to differences in dose- or time-response curves nor to differential c-AMP escape into culture medium. Since CF cells synthesize more c-AMP than controls only in response to isoproterenol but not to prostaglandin E1, the alteration which might be responsible for the observed phenomenon is probably located proximal of the adenylate cyclase at the cells border between intra- and extracellular space.", "79178": "Aggett-P-J.

With extensive studies, we collected experimental data which contribute five major arguments in favour of the proposition that CF may be an enzyme recognition site mutant. With fibroblast cultures the three genotypes can be separated in the following way: CF homozygote, leaky for alkaline phosphatase (A1P) and lysosomal hydrolases/A1P is Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP) inducible; CF heterozygote, leaky for A1P and lysosomal hydrolases/A1P is not THP inducible; normal control, not leaky for A1P and lysosomal enzymes/A1P is not THP inducible.

The distribution of results for the CF patients (mean TSBA concentration 27.0 micromol/l) and for the age-matched controls (mean concentration 19.9 micromol/l) shows a wider range for the CF group. Statistical analysis, however, of these two groups shows no significant difference between them.

Our aim was to investigate bronchial allergy in a group of children with CF and positive skin tests. We studied 15 children aged 7 to 16 years with mild to moderate respiratory disease. Only 1 child gave a history of wheezing not associated with chest infections and this study supports the hypothesis that clinical asthma is a product of bronchial allergy and broncholability.

SPUTUM: im.We focused our study on concentration of immunoglobulins, lysozyme, lactoferrin, some antiproteolytic fractions and acute phase proteins in bronchial secretion of children with various pulmonary diseases, especially with cystic fibrosis. Secretory IgA is decreased in all studied groups of patients having chronic or recurrent infections of the respiratory tract (when compared to the group of healthy children). Groups which were characterized by the infection of the lower part of the respiratory tract had increased lysozyme level. The results obtained in the group of CF children are similar to those obtained in groups with bronchiectasis and chronic bronchitis, which suggests that the observed differences are characteristic for chronic infection rather than for CF. Although in CF as well as in bronchiectasis massive bacterial infection results in increased concentration of immunoglobulins, antiproteolytic fractions and acute phase proteins, the results seen in both groups are somewhat different. These differences may indicate some difference in the reactivity to infection of the respiratory tract in CF in comparison to patients with bronchiectasis. It seems conceivable that among children with CF who have very low S-IgA, chronic respiratory tract infections occur earlier and IgG response to permanent exposition to variety of antigens is less vigorous. The presented results raise also a possibility that the bacterial infection in CF does not stimulate defence mechanisms to the same extent as in bronchiectasis.", "79191": "Schiotz-P-O. Sorensen-H.

LUNG: pa.This study examined whether biologic activation of C3 with subsequent pulmonary inflammation takes place in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis. Plasma complement C3 levels were all normal. Eleven of the patients with the C3 split product C3c were from the group of 14 patients suffering from chronic infection with mucoid strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 2 were from the group of 14 CF patients without P. aeruginosa infection. This difference was significant (p < 0.002). A comparison of albumin ratios between the 13 patients with the C3 split product C3c and the remaining other 15 patients showed a significant higher ratio in the former group (p < 0.01) on an average 4.1 versus 1.4 per cent. The significantly higher albumin ratio demonstrated in the patients with C3c in their sputum sol phase supports the concept of complement-induced inflammation with subsequent transudation of plasma proteins in these patients. This study thus shows that complement-mediated inflammatory reactions may play an important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary tissue damage in patients with CF, even when the plasma C3 levels are normal, and it supports the concept of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection as an immune complex disease in CF patients.", "79192": "Hein-J.

We compared the results with a control group of 12 healthy children of the same age and sex. Furthermore, children with bronchial asthma and chronic bronchitis were examined. The flow rate of the parotid and the protein output without stimulation were nearly the same for the four groups. In patients with CF the protein output after stimulation was significantly lower. An increased level of sodium was observed in the stimulated secretion and the unstimulated saliva as well. In CF children we found a significant higher output of sodium in both stimulated parotid saliva and unstimulated parotid saliva. The IgG output of the gland after stimulation was found to be slightly reduced in patients with CF in comparison to healthy children. The output of the gland for IgA after stimulation was observed to be strongly reduced for the group with CF and for the group with bronchial asthma. The decreased output of the gland for secretory IgA after stimulation was demonstrated again in CF and in bronchial asthma in comparison with healthy persons. The increased sodium concentration in parotid saliva may be caused in a similar way as the electrolyte abnormality of sweat in CF patients, namely by a decreased net reabsorption of sodium. Due to the result of an increased electrolyte output and decreased immunoglobulin output of parotid gland we can suppose that the molecular magnitude plays its role in this disturbance.", "79193": "Hoiby-N.

As a consequence of this hypothesis, one would expect cystic fibrosis patients to produce a pronounced antibody response against the intestinal bacterial flora. The present work was therefore carried out to investigate the antibody response in CF patients and in normal persons against Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis which are present in the gut in large numbers and against the respiratory pathogen P. aeruginosa. A significantly higher prevalence of precipitins against each of the 3 bacterial species was found in CF patients compared to normal persons, and the prevalence of precipitins against each of these bacteria increased significantly with age. As regards P. aeruginosa precipitins, the prevalence and number was significantly higher in CF patients who have subsequently succumbed compared to CF patients who are still alive. Such a correlation between the antibody response and the prognosis of the patients was not found as regards E. coli or B. fragilis. Considering the hypothesis of Wallwork and co-workers concerning increased absorption of antigens from the gut, it seems more attractive to suppose that increased absorption of antigens from the gut flora occurs predominantly in CF patients with P. aeruginosa lung infection with a pronounced antibody response against P. aeruginosa.", "79194": "Prosser-R.Screening for cystic fibrosis in the newborn.Monogr-Paediatr. 1979. 10.

The present study was carried out to determine whether sulphated blood-group substances occur in normal pancreatic tissue. The distribution of sulphate over the exocrine part of pancreas does coincide with the distribution of blood-group substance previously observed by fluorescent microscopy. We therefore find it very likely that the sulphate and blood-group substance are associated with the same glycoprotein molecule. Since blood-group substance has been demonstrated in many secretions in man, and since high amounts of sulphate have been found in the mucous glands in CF, such a mechanism is possible in many locations and may thus offer an explanation for the multiorgan involvement in CF.", "79196": "Ryley-H-C.An evaluation of the meconium 'lactase test' for the detection of cystic fibrosis in the newborn.Monogr-Paediatr. 1979. 10.

We also describe subsequent studies which show increased mitochondrial electron transport activity, measured as oxygen uptake by whole cells, in cells from subjects with CF and obligate heterozygotes. One can hypothesise a mechanism to link the altered mitochondrial Ca in CF fibroblasts and the major signs associated with the disease. Data suggest that the electron transport system in CF and obligate heterozygote fibroblasts is more active than that in respective controls, in the conditions of this study.

RATS.Lung lavage samples from rats treated in a chronic fashion with reserpine had mean increases of 133, 170, and 120% in the total protein, lipid, and carbohydrate contents, respectively, when compared with those of untreated control animals, when these values were expressed in terms of body weight. An acute single ip injection of the beta-adrenergic agent isoproterenol (10 mg) increased the glycoprotein content of pulmonary lavage fluid from control rats approximately 15-19%, but only 9-10% in those from reserpine treated rats. By contrast, pilocarpine (10 mg), administered in the same manner, caused a 15% increase in the total protein, carbohydrate, and lipid content of lavage samples from control rats and increased these same constituents in the lavage samples of reserpine treated rats 98, 102, and 80%, respectively. The increased total carbohydrate content in the lavage samples of the treated animals was not associated with changes in the percent distribution of neutral sugars, amino sugars, or sialic acid. The ratio of these various sugar components did not change in the lavage samples of control or reserpine treated rats upon stimulation with either pilocarpine or isoproterenol. The increased total lipid content fround in the lavage samples from the treated rats probably results from an increase in phospholipids. A decrease in phospholipid content occurred in the lavage samples of reserpine treated rats upon stimulation, while the opposite was observed in those of control animals. Chronic treatment of rats with reserpine, thus, appears to induce an enhanced production of glycoproteins in the airways and to interfere with phospholipid metabolism in the lung. In addition, the drug treatment enhances the secretory response to pilocarpine in comparison with the responses of control animals. The enhanced response or hypersecretion of glycoproteins is a quantitative one and does not seem to involve alterations in the ratios or distribution of the various sugar components. This disturbance in the secretory function of the respiratory tract, a target organ which is prominently involved in cystic fibrosis (CF) together with alterations in other exocrine glands which resemble those of CF patients, makes the reserpine treated rat a useful model for further study of possible pathogenetic mechanisms in CF. The experimental animal model for CF developed by the chronic administration of reserpine to rats has been found to have changes in the protein content of lung lavage samples, in addition to morphologic and secretory alterations in the salivary glands and the pancreas. Further analysis of the organic composition of lung lavage samples shows that the protein, carbohydrate, and lipid contents are significantly increased after chronic reserpine administration and that the response to stimulation with pilocarpine is enhanced in the treated animals when compared to that of untreated control rats. It therefore appears that chronic reserpine administration causes a hypersecretion of glycoproteins and changes in lipid metabolism in the respiratory tract of the rat and that, in conjunction with previous findings in other exocrine glands, these effects on lung function make the reserpine treated rat a useful tool for the study of the pathologic disturbance seen in the major exocrine glands affected in CF.", "79218": "Russell-D-H.

Results demonstrated that submaxillary saliva from the treated animals caused a 69% inhibition of Na+ reabsorption, accompanied by a 28% reduction in the volume of saliva secreted, and a 22% reduction in flow rate. By contrast, submaxillary saliva from control rats caused a 6% inhibition of Na+ reabsorption, a 6% reduction in volume, and a 5% reduction in flow rate. Parotid saliva from reserpine-treated rats also inhibited Na+ reabsorption to the extent of 39% and caused a 38% reduction in volume and a 33% reduction in flow. Parotid saliva from control rats only inhibited Na+ reabsorption to the extent of 2.7% and caused a 4-- 6% reduction in salivary volumes and flow rates. The inhibition of Na+ reabsorption and the reduction in salivary volume and flow rates caused by submaxillary saliva of reserpine-treated rats were either abolished or significantly reduced when the saliva was previously heated to 100 degrees C, frozen, and then thawed or kept in glass tubes at 4 degrees C for 24 hr.

RATS.Sera from patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas (CF) and normal human sera were assayed for the ability to inhibit sodium- dependent glucose transport in rat brush-border membrane vesicles. Fresh CF and age- and sex-matched control sera were both inhibitory when compared to physiologic saline. The inhibition by CF serum was 44 +/- 13% (mean +/- SD) at a final serum concentration of 6.7%, 67 +/- 34% at 10% serum, and 68 +/- 28% at 20% serum. The ratio of the inhibition of CF sera compared to that of control sera was 1.00, 0.78, and 0.93 at 6.7, 10, and 20% serum concentrations, respectively. Although a slightly greater inhibition by CF serum was observed at a concentration of 10%, this is probably not significant because no difference could be detected at a concentration of 20% serum. Glucose transport in the presence of serum was sensitive to phlorizin indicating that the residual glucose transport was proceeding by the sodium-dependent glucose transport system. These findings suggest that CF serum does not specifically inhibit the sodium-dependent glucose transport system. The intravesicular space accessible to glucose was reduced in the presence of CF or control serum. Fresh CF serum was 1.4 times more effective than fresh control serum (P less than 0.01). The presence of substantial vesicle- shrinking activity in control serum indicates that this activity cannot be considered specific for CF.", "79221": "Feigal-R-J.

HETEROZYGOTE. INTRACELLULAR-FLUID: me.CELLS-CULTURED. CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: fg. FIBROBLASTS: me. HUMAN.The importance of intracellular calcium (Ca) in secretion and transmembrane ion movement led us to study Ca in cells from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) which is a lethal genetic exocrinopathy. Skin fibroblasts from patients with CF, obligate heterozygotes (HZ), and age- and sex-matched controls (C) were used in matched pair experiments measuring 45Ca exchange into and efflux from the cells over time. CF cell lines and HZ cell lines exhibit increased 45Ca exchange when compared with their respective controls (P less than 0.005). The magnitude of this difference (approximately 30%) is not reduced when cells are washed with lanthanum chloride after the exchange period. This difference is likely attributable to an altered capacity of one or more of the intracellular Ca sequestering organelles. Further evidence for this explanation was seen in 45Ca efflux experiments in which CF cells retained a higher percent of their initial 0-time 45Ca than did C cells late in the efflux period (P less than 0.05). The finding of an altered Ca pool size in both CF and particularly HZ cells suggests that altered Ca metabolism is related to the basic gene defect in CF.", "79222": "Van-Leuven-F. Cassiman-J-J.

Crossed immunoelectrophoresis and Ouchterlony double diffusion revealed no qualitative differences between the two alpha 2-M preparations. Trypsin-esterase activity assayed with BAPNA as a substrate, in the presence of an excess STI, gave similar ratios between total and active alpha 2M. These alpha 2M-trypsin complexes were equally stable under various experimental conditions and maintained a constant STI non-inhibited esterase activity. Normal and CF-alpha 2M-trypsin complexes were taken up by normal human fibroblasts to a similar extent during a four hour period. The only significant difference was observed when the uptake of alpha 2M from untreated sera was examined. The uptake of alpha 2M from CF sera was always lower than from pooled control sera despite large variation. Mixing of control and CF serum did not affect the normal uptake and other serum components were taken up to the normal extent. Intracellular degradation of CF alpha 2M had a half life of 2.0 to 2.8 hours, which compares well to the normal half life of 2.2 hours. More work needs to be done on the nature of the interaction between alpha 2M and proteases before a reasonable explanation for the molecular nature of the abnormal behavior can be sought.", "79223": "Thomassen-M-J.

Mixing of CF serum with normal serum could not overcome the inhibitory effect, indicating the presence of an inhibitory factor rather than the lack of a necessary component.

MICE-INBRED-DBA.Serum ciliotoxic activity (SCA), which had been described in cystic fibrosis (CF), was studied in mutant mice with some hereditary alterations resembling this inherited disease. A test was developed to detect SCA in biologic fluids by means of a natural vibratile system; it consisted in the incubation of mouse sperm with different CF serum dilutions under controlled conditions, in order to determine the sperm translation cessation time (STCT) and the sperm activity cessation time (SACT). As the findings of this study were similar to those obtained by other authors who have been employing alternative systems, it was decided to apply this method on mice serum. Sera were obtained from male and female 3- to 4-wk-old mice of DBA/2J-cri, C57BL/6J-bgJ, and BALB/c inbred strains; SCA was investigated in affected homozygotes and their +/? siblings were used as controls. Male 8- to 16-wk-old BALB/c mice were employed as sperm donors. Significant differences were found between cri/cri and +/? mice of the DBA/2J-cri strain in both STCT and SACT determinations at 1/10 serum dilution. It is concluded that mouse sperm is a system sensitive enough to detect SCA in biologic fluids from human beings. Likewise, the test of the mouse sperm allowed us to detect SCA in cri/cri mice, turning this mutation into a possible animal model for CF.", "79225": "Romeo-G. Parsons-M. Bossen-A. Blessing-Moore-J.

However, trypsin binding to IgG has been observed in 80% of CF patients, 30% of their mothers, 3% of controls, and in two patients affected with pancreatitis. These trypsin binding immunoglobulins are called TbIg, and specifically, Tb1gG when referring to the G class. Experimental evidence indicates that binding of trypsin to IgG occurs through the Fab portion of the molecule.

Although we found that the absolute amount of salivary amylase, in the serum of patients with CF and PI, was the same as that for normal subjects, the percent of contribution was considerably higher. We found that the pancreas contributed approximately 23% of the total serum amylase in CF patients with PI, a value very similar to the 34% amount found by Kamaryt et al. We also found, as did Davidson et al., that CF patients without PI had higher total serum amylase values than did normal subjects. Thus, we feel that Davidson et al. have misinterpreted the results of our previous study and, in fact, we feel that Davidson et al. have essentially confirmed our previous work by suggesting that CF patients with pancreatic insufficiency have an increased salivary amylase for reasons yet unknown. Our experience has shown that, indeed, the pancreatic portion is first increased and then decreases as the patient with CF and apparent normal pancreatic function progresses, with time, toward pancreatic insufficiency. However, the changes in serum amylase values in patients with CF are on the average due to changes in the pancreatic contribution to the serum and as expressed as a mean was highly significantly different for both normal and abnormal pancreatic function. The second important point of our paper was that this mean variation occurred in serum samples from patients with CF that had total amylase values within the normal test range.

It is postulated that chronic loss of sweat electrolytes together with mild gastrointestinal or respiratory illness may predispose the infant with cystic fibrosis to a severe electrolyte and acid-base disturbance. The lack of shock and hyperpyrexia together with the apparent chronicity of electrolyte losses differentiates metabolic alkalosis from the heat prostration syndrome, a more acute complication of cystic fibrosis.

These lesions involved mainly the left ventricle and spared the endocardium, the pericardium, and the coronary vessels. These necrotic of fibrotic heart lesions were found to be closely associated with various pancreatic diseases: cystic fibrosis (11 cases), pancreatic lipomatosis (2 cases), extensive small bowel resection (3 cases, 2 of which were associated with acute interstitial pancreatitis). To explain these unexpected associations, two hypotheses can be put forth: (1) The lack of absorption of some presently undetermined substances indispensable for the correct trophicity of the myocardium, and (2) the release in the blood of proteolytic enzymes with consecutive activation of phlogistic substances such as kinins.", "79238": "Phelps-D-L.Vitamin E: where do we stand?.Pediatrics. 1979 Jun. 63(6).

It was our impression that the use of forced expiration when combined with periods of relaxed diaphragmatic breathing did not aggravate bronchospasm and shortened the postural drainage session. Two groups of patients were studied: 24 with cystic fibrosis to evaluate the use of the FET as an independent means of postural drainage; and 20 asthmatic patients to assess the effect of the FET on bronchospasm. The studies indicate that the forced expiration technique increases the efficiency of postural drainage, but does not increase airway obstruction.

When the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor rotenone was added to the cells, the relative inhibition of O2 consumption was CF greater than HZ greater than controls (P less than 0.005 in both comparisons). Because rotenone specifically inhibits NADH dehydrogenase, [NADH: (acceptor) oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.99.3], which is the enzyme of energy-conserving site 1 of the mitochondrial electron transport system, activity and kinetics of this enzyme system were studied in fibroblast homogenates. NADH dehydrogenase activity was equal in cells from the three genotypes. At pH 8.0, affinity of the enzyme for its substrate was CF greater than HZ = controls; at pH 8.6, affinity was CF greater than HZ = controls (P less than 0.005 for the differences). pH optima for the genotypes were without exception 8.6 (CF), 8.3 (HZ), and 8.0 (control). HZ and control lines were distinguished unequivocally in a blind test on the basis of differences in pH optima. Purified mitochondrial preparations revealed pH optima identical to those found in whole cell homogenates.

Firstly, the thick, fibrotic retroperitoneal area in the porta hepatis, where a portacaval shunt has to be constructed, can be avoided, which makes the distal splenorenal shunt the easier operation. Secondly, notwithstanding the relatively small-sized vessels, a wide anastomosis can be constructed with a high flow rate and, therefore, a minimal chance of shunt thrombosis.", "79256": "Bowman-B-H.Cystic fibrosis: review of investigations of the mucociliary inhibitor.Tex-Rep-Biol-Med. 1979. 38.

Fifty-two subjects who were normal, 30 with cystic fibrosis (CF), and 35 with asthma were selected on the basis of normal spirometry, informed consent being obtained from them and their parents. Tests undertaken were measurement of maximum expiratory flow volume curves breathing air and a helium-oxygen mixture, single breath nitrogen washout curves, lung volumes, and, except in the normal subjects, measurement of arterial oxygen tension. Closing volumes were normal in most children with CF and asthma, whereas the slope of the alveolar plateau was abnormal in 83%. Maximum expiratory flow rate at 50% of total lung capacity was reduced in 65% and maximum mid-expiratory flow rate in 57%; residual volume increased in 51%, and results of other tests were abnormal in less than 50% of the children. There was evidence suggesting that lung disease was more patchy in children with mild CF than in those with interval phase asthma.

To confirm our theory, we planned to search for additional lectin-like activities in CF serum. Our experiments suggest that the lectin-like substance in CF blood requires IgM for its red-blood-cell-agglutination activity. Thus, no difference in agglutination titer is observed between CF homozygotes and heterozygotes, because IgM is the limiting factor, and IgM concentrations do not differ appreciably in such subjects. We suspect that CF homozygotes have a larger pool of free lectin in their blood than do heterozygotes, so that quantitation of this free lectin pool may distinguish between the two phenotypes. Excess free lectin may account for the signs and symptoms of CF, whereas lesser amounts may theoretically be advantageous to the heterozygote.", "79259": "Bohles-H. Heid-H. Stehr-K.
