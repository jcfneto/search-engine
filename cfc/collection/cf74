AB The significance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the
   respiratory tract of 9 cystic fibrosis patients have been studied
   by means of immunoelectrophoretical analysis of patients' sera for
   the number of precipitins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the
   concentrations of 16 serum proteins.  In addition, the clinical and
   radiographical status of the lungs have been evaluated using 2
   scoring systems.  Precipitins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were
   demonstrated in all sera, the maximum number in one serum was 22.
   The concentrations of 12 of the serum proteins were significantly
   changed compared with matched control persons.  Notably IgG and IgA
   were elevated and the "acute phase proteins" were changed, the
   latter suggesting active tissue damage.  The concentrations of 3 of
   the acute phase proteins, notably haptoglobin, were correlated to
   the number of precipitins suggesting that the respiratory tract
   infection in patients with many precipitins is accompanied by more
   tissue damage than the infection in patients with few precipitins.
   The results indicate no protective value of the many precipitins on
   the tissue of the respiratory tract.

AB Salivary amylase levels were determined in normal subjects from
   birth until adult life and in children with conditions sometimes
   associated with low pancreatic amylase such as malnutrition, coeliac
   disease and cystic fibrosis.  Mixed saliva was collected under
   carefully standardised conditions and amylase was measured by the
   method of Dahlqvist.  There was a wide scatter of values in the 84
   normal subjects, but concentrations rose from very low levels at
   birth to reach adult levels by the age of 6 months to 1 year.
   Salivary amylase activity rose normally over ten weeks in one
   premature infant fed milk by gastrostomy.  Thirteen children with
   coeliac disease and 9 children with cystic fibrosis mostly had
   normal salivary amylase concentrations.  Six out of 12 malnourished
   children with jejunal villous atrophy of uncertain aetiology had low
   levels which rose to normal as recovery began.

AB This article reports on the possibility of using instrumental
   neutron activation analysis (INAA) of sodium in nail clippings for
   diagnosing cystic fibrosis (CF) in children and adults, for
   detecting heterozygotes and for screening in the neonatal period.
   Nail clippings from 1322 newborns, 22 CF patients (two of them
   newborns), 52 healthy controls and 22 heterozygotes were analyzed.
   The discrimination between CF patients and controls was found to be
   precise for individuals above one year of age and INAA of nail
   clippings should be accepted as a diagnostic test for CF after this
   age.  Heterozygotes could not be detected by the method.  During the
   first five days of life there is a big overlap between the values
   from normal newborns and those of CF children, which makes the
   method invaluable for early screening for CF.

AB Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of nail clippings
   was used in the development of a diagnostic method for cystic
   fibrosis (CF).  From CF patients and controls more than three years
   old, nail clippings were sampled for tests of different errors.  As
   a result of this study a precise collection routine was outlined.
   Sodium is easily washed out from nail clippings.  The risk of sodium
   contamination of the nails seems to be small.  The sodium
   distribution in the nail is inhomogeneous, and the sodium content
   varies also from nail to nail in the same person.  There is good
   evidence that the increased sodium in the nails of CF patients comes
   from the sweat.  There seems to be a basic "intrinsic" sodium level,
   which is about the same in the nails of CF patients as in controls.
   The precision and accuracy of INAA for determining sodium in nails
   is considered satisfactory.  It is concluded that INAA of the sodium
   concentration in nail clippings is a suitable method as an aid in
   the diagnosis of CF if a precise collection routine is used.

AB The capacity of duodenal juice to hydrolyse casein to
   trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptides was investigated: in a control
   group (11 infants and children and 7 adults); in 5 children with
   pancreatic disease; in 10 children with enterogenic malabsorption
   (coeliac disease and cow's milk protein intolerance).  The
   proteolytic activity per ml duodenal juice in fasting condition was
   as great in healthy infants and children as healthy adults (500-600
   mg casein/ml/hour).  There was a good correlation between trypsin
   content and proteolytic activity of duodenal juice.  In pancreatic
   insufficiency, the proteolytic activity was extremely low (not
   measurable in 3 patients) as was the trypsin activity whereas in
   enterogenic malabsorption, it was within the ranges of the controls.

AB The influence of chronic Ps. aeruginosa infection on the occurrence
   of bone marrow-derived lymphocytes (B cells) and thymus-derived
   lymphocytes (T cells) in peripheral blood have been studied in 2
   groups of patients with cystic fibrosis.  One group (9 patients)
   suffered from chronic Ps. aeruginosa infection in the respiratory
   tract and produced multiple Ps. aeruginosa precipitins which were
   demonstrated by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis.  The other
   group (9 patients) had never harboured Ps. aeruginosa in the
   respiratory tract and presented no demonstrable precipitins against
   this bacteria.  The lymphocytes were examined for the presence of
   2 surface markers for B cells: receptor for C3 complement component
   (EAC rosette-formation) and surface immunoglobulins
   (immunofluorescent staining), and for the presence of 1 surface
   marker for T cells: spontaneous binding of sheep red blood cells (E
   rosette-formation).  The B:T cell ratio was nearly identical in the
   2 groups of patients whereas the total numbers of B and T cells were
   significant higher in patients with chronic Ps. aeruginosa
   infection.  The number of Ps. aeruginosa precipitins per serum was
   significantly positively correlated to the total number of T cells,
   wheras the correlation with the total number of B cells was
   insignificant.

AB The occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the respiratory tract
   of 70 cystic fibrosis patients and the occurrence of precipitins
   against Ps. aeruginosa in sera from the same patients have been
   investigated during one year by means of monthly bacteriological
   examinations of tracheal secretions and by means of crossed
   immunoelectrophoresis of a polyvalent Ps. aeruginosa antigen
   against sera from the patients.  The one-year period prevalence
   rate of patients harbouring Ps. aeruginosa was 64 per cent.  In
   newly colonized patients and in intermittently colonized patients
   non-mucoid strains were predominating, whereas mucoid strains were
   predominating in chronically colonized patients.  The occurrence of
   mucoid strains, especially in chronically colonized patients, was
   associated with a significantly higher number of precipitins against
   Ps. aeruginosa than the occurrence of non-mucoid strains.  Males
   chronically colonized with mucoid strains presented a significantly
   higher number of precipitins than females chronically colonized
   with mucoid strains and the number of precipitins was correlated
   with the duration of the chronic colonization with Ps. aeruginosa
   in males in contrast to females.  The results are in accordance
   with the hypothesis that mucoid substance could be a virulence
   factor because it might inhibit the opsonizing effect of the
   precipitins on the mucoid cells and the complement dependent lysis of
   the cells hereby favouring mucoid strains at the expense on
   non-mucoid strains in the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis
   patients.

AB Seventy patients with cystic fibrosis treated as out-patients in a
   cystic fibrosis clinic have been followed during one year by
   monthly bacteriological examinations of tracheal secretions.  The
   daily impression obtained in the laboratory is expressed by the
   mean point prevalence rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 44 per cent,
   Staphylococcus aureus: 39 per cent, Haemophilus influenzae: 17 per
   cent, Diplococcus pneumoniae: 8 per cent, and miscellaneous other
   bacteria, mainly Enterobacteriaceae: 8 per cent.  The fluctuations
   of the bacteriology are described by additional epidemiological
   terms: At one or more examinations during the study (period
   prevalence rate), 90 per cent of the patients harboured St. aureus,
   64 per cent Ps. aeruginosa (mainly mucoid strains), 64 per cent H.
   influenzae, 37 per cent D. pneumoniae, and 30 per cent miscellaneous
   other bacteria, mainly Enterobacteriaceae.  This pattern was found
   in all age groups with minor age-dependent modifications, especially
   as regards Enterobacteriaceae.  Ps. aeruginosa was predominating as
   regards chronic colonization which reflects the most difficult
   therapeutic problems, the period prevalence rate being 39 per cent
   in contrast to St. aureus: 10 per cent, and H. influenzae: 1 per
   cent.  St. aureus was predominating as regards new colonization and
   recolonization which reflect the problems of prevention, the
   incidence rate of new colonization and recolonization per risk group
   being 84 per cent, followed by H. influenzae: 62 per cent, Ps.
   aeruginosa: 43 per cent, and D. pneumoniae: 30 per cent.  The
   results show that the bacteriological problems in cystic fibrosis
   are still considerable as regards therapy as well as prevention.
   Although many species may colonize the respiratory tracts of these
   patients, the main clinical problems concern Ps. aeruginosa and St.
   aureus; the reason why is discussed.

AB A family is presented in which celiac sprue and cystic fibrosis
   occurred within the same sibship.  A cousin of the index case was
   also discovered to have celiac sprue.  The genetics and incidence of
   both conditions is reviewed.  It is estimated that the likelihood of
   this association occurring on the basis of chance in this family is
   1 in 50,000.

AB A patient exhibited the features of both Kartagener syndrome and
   cystic fibrosis.  At most, to the authors' knowledge, this
   represents the third such report of the combination.  Cystic
   fibrosis should be excluded before a diagnosis of Kartagener
   syndrome is made.

AB The prevalence of respiratory allergies and their effects on the
   course of cystic fibrosis (CF) were studied in 63 patients.  Fifteen
   patients (24%) had respiratory allergies as defined by history,
   physical examination, positive allergy skin tests, nasal and
   peripheral eosinophilia, and reversible airway obstruction.  Serum
   immunoglobulins on these 15 allergic CF and 22 nonallergic CF
   patients were elevated when compared with those in normal age-matched
   controls.  The allergic CF patients had significantly higher IgE
   levels (mean 598 international units [IU] compared to 281 IU); IgG,
   IgM, and IgA levels were similar in the two CF groups.  The clinical
   condition of the allergic CF patients, (Shwachman score) was better
   than the nonallergic, suggesting some modulating effect of
   respiratory allergy on the severity of the disease.

EX Taussig et al reported a case of a 6-year-old boy with the Russell
   variant of the Silver-Russell syndrome concomitant with cystic
   fibrosis.  We would like to describe another patient who had the
   same combination of diseases.  The pattern of clinical findings in
   this patient are in accordance with that of the Silver-Russell
   syndrome.  It is, of course, possible that the development of
   cystic fibrosis in this patient is entirely accidental, although
   such a coincidence would be a statistically rare event.  The
   establishment of a possible relationship between these two
   conditions would depend on reports of other similar cases.

AB An intensive search for blacks with cystic fibrosis (CF) in
   Washington, DC, during the period 1962 to 1971 disclosed 16 black
   patients, eight of whom were born in the District of Columbia during
   this decade.  The calculated incidence of CF is at least one in
   17,033 black newborns.  The clinical course and pathological changes
   in blacks with CF are similar to those in whites.  Genetic
   considerations point to autosomal recessive inheritance in blacks,
   which is generally accepted for whites with this disease.

EX Prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders has received increasing
   attention during the past several years.  Rapid expansion of our
   knowledge of the basis of genetic disease and the development of
   reliable diagnostic methods have led to rapid advances in the
   intrauterine diagnosis of a large number of inherited disorders.
   Prenatal diagnosis was initially used to determine the presence of
   Down's syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities and for the
   determination of fetal sex in pregnancies at risk for a number of
   severe X-linked recessive disorders.  Shortly thereafter, it became
   clear that the same techniques could be applied to the prenatal
   diagnosis of a number of the inborn errors of metabolism.  Most
   recently, a number of new techniques have been developed that may
   prove to be of great value in the prenatal diagnosis of a number of
   severe congenital malformations that before now could not be
   diagnosed prior to birth.  The goal of this review is to define the
   past achievements, future goals, and present limitations of
   intrauterine diagnosis.  The first section will deal with the general
   approaches used in prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders.  This
   will be followed by a discussion of the specific applications of the
   basic techniques to the intrauterine diagnosis of chromosomal
   abnormalities and of the inborn errors of metabolism.  Approaches to
   prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders include amniocentesis, direct
   and indirect visualization of the fetus, analysis of maternal blood
   and urine, and sampling of fetal tissues.  Applications of prenatal
   genetic diagnosis include X-linked recessive disorders, chromosomal
   abnormalities, inborn errors of metabolism, disorders of lipid
   metabolism, disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, disorders of
   mucopolysaccharide metabolism, disorders of amino acid metabolism,
   and miscellaneous disorders such as cystic fibrosis.  These
   techniques provide some parents with methods for having children
   without fear of having a child with a specific deformity.  In
   addition to the development of approaches which will increase the
   number of disorders detectable in utero, the potential for treatment
   of genetic disorders is unlimited.

AB Three of the 4 women in a cystic fibrosis clinic who used a combined
   form of oral contraceptive developed acute polypoid cervicitis.  In
   one woman, the polyp recurred on reinstitution of the medication.
   There was resolution of the polyp in each instance on
   discontinuation of the drugs.  In 2 of the 3 affected women, there
   was coincidental deterioration of respiratory status.  Therefore, it
   is suggested that cystic fibrosis patients who are using oral
   contraception be observed closely regarding pulmonary and
   gynecologic status.

   progressive neurologic degeneration, cutaneous and conjunctival
   telangiectasis, and immunologic deficiency.  Roentgenologic evidence
   of chronic pulmonary and sinus infections and decreased lymphoid
   tissue will usually be present.  As the sinopulmonary abnormalities
   resemble those of cystic fibrosis, a small adenoidal mass may be of
   differential aid.

   SPIROMETRY.
EX Cystic fibrosis is no longer rare in adults.  The lung is the main
   target organ and the basic lesion is bronchial obstruction leading to
   bronchiectasis.  Interstitial infiltrates and cyst-like changes are
   characteristic on roentgenography.  Complications include pulmonary
   hypertension, pneumonitis, hemorrhage, and pneumothorax.  Little
   correlation exists between respiratory tract and pancreatic and
   gastrointestinal involvement, despite similarities in pathogenesis.
   Pulmonary cystic fibrosis in adults does not always resemble the
   condition in children, and must be differentiated from other chronic
   interstitial diseases.

EX As far as rabbit alveolar macrophages are concerned,
   the concentration of homozygous CF serum used in our experiments
   was even greater than the fourfold concentration which Biggar and
   associates state was required for normal phagocytosis.  Increasing
   dilutions of homozygous CF sera with either Hanks balanced salt
   solution or normal human serum, thus decreasing its concentration,
   increased the capacity of the rabbit alveolar macrophages to
   phagocytize and kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Increasing
   concentrations had just the opposite effect.  Suspension of rabbit
   alveolar macrophages in human serum reduced their phagocytic
   activity, but activity was reduced more by human CF serum than by
   human normal serum.  This is not unexpected because high human
   serum concentrations are likely to be toxic to rabbit alveolar
   macrophages.  Because the inhibition of phagocytosis was absent
   when homozygous CF serum more than 24 hours old or previously
   heated or frozen was used and because of our observations that
   dilution increased macrophage phagocytic ability, we feel our data
   demonstrate the presence of a labile inhibitor rather than a
   deficiency.  Since it is well known that CF patients have normal
   or elevated concentrations of immunoglobulins including IgA in
   their sera and pulmonary secretions and respond to infection, and
   IgA has not been shown to be essential for alveolar macrophage
   phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we cannot agree that this
   inhibition is due to an IgA deficiency.  We also note that some of
   the sera used in the experiments of Biggar and associates were
   stored at -70 degrees C.  Perhaps this may account for the
   difference in results.

EX We assayed the serum of a group of cystic fibrosis patients that
   were on oral arginine therapy and that of a group of cystic
   fibrosis patients that were not receiving this treatment for total
   arginine esterase activity.  The untreated cystic fibrosis patients
   have significantly lower serum arginine esterase activity than the
   normal controls, the cystic fibrosis carriers, and the cystic
   fibrosis patients receiving oral arginine therapy.  There is no
   significant difference between the arginine esterase activity of
   the normal controls and the cystic fibrosis carriers or the cystic
   fibrosis patients treated with arginine. -  We have recently
   observed differences in the arginine esterases in plasma of
   controls and patients by electrofusing on polyacrylamide gels.
   Six activity bands could be detected in plasma of controls, whereas
   only five could be detected in plasma of patients.  Our work on the
   deficiency of trypsin-like activity in mixed saliva of patients
   with cystic fibrosis has been reproduced by another laboratory.
   Coburn recently confirmed our work on deficiency of arginine
   esterase in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis. At present, the
   deficiency of arginine esterase in cystic fibrosis is a working
   hypothesis to understand the basic defect. - The variations of pH
   and sodium chloride content that I employed had been tested by me
   in 6 patients both with and without a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis
   and were found not to alter the level of arginine-esterase
   activity.  The major differences between the two studies resulted
   from the control subjects.  Dr. Rao neglects to mention the few
   other laboratories that were unable to confirm his findings.

AB The ability to detect abnormalities of lung function in children
   with asthma and cystic fibrosis by the measurement of closing
   volume was studied in 205 children.  Flow volume characteristics,
   routine spirometry, body plethysmography, and arterialized
   oxygen tensions were studied for comparison with closing volume.
   Closing volume was less sensitive in detecting disease than were
   the residual volume to total lung capacity ratio, maximum expiratory
   flow volume curves, and arterialized blood gases.

AB Airway resistance and lung volume were measured by a modification of
   the plethysmographic method of Briscoe and DuBois (1) to calculate
   specific airway resistance (SRaw) on 263 control subjects ranging in
   age from the newborn to 54 years.  the mean SRaw was lowest in the
   newborn period and increased rapidly to adult levels during the
   first years of life.  In each age group, the mean SRaw was lower for
   females than it was for males.  No control subject had an SRaw
   greater than 8 sec cm H2O.  A decrease in mean SRaw from 4.2 sec cm
   H2O for females 5 to 9 years of age to 3.5 sec cm H2O for those over
   18 years of age paralleled sexual maturation, but similar changes
   were not observed in the males.  A direct correlation of SRaw with
   clinical observations was found in young patients with various
   degrees of pulmonary involvement because of cystic fibrosis.

AB Ciliated nasal polyp epithelium from patients with allergic rhinitis
   and patients with cystic fibrosis was maintained in organ culture
   for 168 hours.  Explanted epithelium retained its morphologic
   characteristics and incorporated 35SO4 and 3H into blood group
   specific glycoproteins that were secreted into the medium throughout
   the culture period.  Labeled mucous glycoprotein was solubilized by
   reduction and alkylation, then purified by gel filtration
   chromatography.  Purified glycoprotein was further separated on
   diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose columns into 3 blood group active
   fractions.  These fractions had similar amino acid compositions but
   differed in N-acetyl neuraminic acid and fucose content and in
   relative incorporation of 35SO4 and 3H-glucosamine.  Blood group
   glycoproteins from polyp epithelium of patients with allergic
   rhinitis and cystic fibrosis were indistinguishable in many
   respects.  However, the 35SO4 per 3H ratio of all 3 glycoprotein
   fractions from patients with cystic fibrosis exceeded that of the
   corresponding fractions from secretions of patients with allergic

AB The pressure-volume behavior of the lung was studied in 24 patients
   with cystic fibrosis.  Isovolume flow-pressure relationships were
   measured in 7 of these patients, and a modification of the
   flow-volume test was evaluated for detection of flow reduction in a
   separate group of 63 patients.  Relative to results in a control
   group of 31 normal subjects, 13 of the 24 patients had grossly
   abnormal pressure-volume curves with excessive stiffness of the lung
   near maximum volume and loss of recoil at lower volume.  Closing
   volumes in these patients were often high enough to cause
   significant disturbances in gas exchange and the elevated closing
   volumes were quantitatively explained by the low values for elastic
   recoil.  The modified flow-volume test detected mild flow reduction
   in many patients who otherwise had normal pulmonary function tests.
   Loss of recoil per se did not account for the low maximum expiratory
   flows, since "upstream" resistances were high.  However,
   pressure-flow curves were effort-dependent at high lung volumes even
   in patients with severe airway obstruction, showing that time
   constants of emptying varied widely in these patients.  It was
   concluded that deterioration of lung function in cystic fibrosis
   involves more than airway obstruction and that the worsening gas
   trapping is explained by a progressive loss of lung elastic recoil.

AB Use of bland aerosols, particularly mist tents, in the treatment of
   lower respiratory disease was reviewed and no convincing evidence of
   efficacy was found.  This is not surprising because there is
   evidence that mist tents deposit little water in the lower
   respiratory tract.  Mist tents may be detrimental, in some cases,
   because of bacterial contamination and because they can cause
   bronchospasm.

AB Plasma arginine esterase activity was measured in 13 young adult
   patients with cystic fibrosis and in 36 control subjects.  The
   enzyme was activated by treating the plasma with chloroform and
   ellagic acid in the manner described by Rao and associates (1).  No
   difference was found either between the arginine esterase activities
   of the patients with cystic fibrosis and the control subjects, or
   between the degrees of activity inhibited by soybean trypsin
   inhibitor.  Thus, the findings of Rao and associates of a deficiency
   of arginine esterase activity in the plasma of patients with cystic
   fibrosis were not confirmed.

AB In spite of the widespread clinical impression that pulmonary
   physical therapy, including breathing exercises, is helpful in the
   pediatric age group, objective demonstration of the value of the
   various maneuvers is for the most part lacking.  There is evidence
   that the volume of sputum produced over short periods of time in
   patients with cystic fibrosis is increased when cough is accompanied
   by postural drainage and pulmonary physical therapy, but the
   long-term effect of the various maneuvers on the course of the
   chronic pulmonary disease remains unknown.

   deaf, associated with eustachian tube dysfunction.  There were no
   confirmed cases of secretory otitis media.  10 children (20%) were
   found to have nasal polyps or gave a history of polypectomy.  Though
   a high incidence of middle ear problems in children with cystic
   fibrosis has been reported in the U.S.A., neither deafness nor
   secretory otitis media was found to be a problem in the group

EX Patients with cystic fibrosis have tocopherol deficiency presumably
   as a result of steatorrhoea.  Evidence for possible muscular
   involvement in cystic fibrosis patients is clinical (muscular
   weakness and wasting in many patients), biochemical (creatinuria on
   a creatine-poor diet, with reversal of this finding after ingestion
   of tocopherol esters, accompanied by a decrease in creatine in
   plasma and an increase in creatine in muscle), and pathological
   (focal lesions in skeletal muscle resembling nutritional muscular
   dystrophy, and ceroid pigment in smooth muscle).  Muscle strength
   was measured with a bulb ergograph in 45 patients with cystic
   fibrosis attending the clinics at the Babies' Hospital, Columbia
   Presbyterian Medical Center, New York.  In a double-blind study, in
   which half the cases received tocopherol orally, and the remainder
   placebo, no significant increase in muscle strength was found in
   those patients receiving tocopherol over a period of 6 months as
   compared to the placebo group.  Blood tocopherol levels in the
   treated group returned to normal.

AB The hypothesis that mist tent therapy decreases the viscosity of
   sputum by direct liquefaction of the sputum in the lower respiratory
   tract was tested in 6 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).  The first
   night all patients slept without the mist tent and the first morning
   sputum was collected for analysis.  The following 2 nights patients
   were randomly allocated to a tent supplied by either a jet or
   ultrasonic nebulizer.  The early morning sputum was analysed for
   volume, viscosity, water content, and DNA content, an index of
   purulence.  There was no relation between sputum viscosity and DNA
   content, water content, or volume.  Furthermore, there was no
   consistent relation between sputum viscosity or volume expectorated
   and the presence or absence of an 8-hour stay in the tent with
   either method of water nebulization.  These results therefore
   suggest that mist therapy does not consistently influence sputum
   viscosity or volume in patients with CF.  Above a sputum water
   content of 90%, further increases in water content do not influence
   viscosity.

EX Cellulose acetate strip electrophoresis was found to be not
   sufficiently reliable to differentiate between normal and CF
   meconium, but marked differences were obtained when quantitative
   immunoelectrophoretic methods were employed.  Normal meconium was
   shown to contain alpha1-antitrypsin and alpha1-antichymotrypsin and
   most samples contained low concentrations of albumin, and measurable
   amounts of a variety of other plasma proteins.  It is suggested that
   quantitative immunoelectrophoresis could be used as a means of
   confirming the diagnosis of CF if positive results are obtained when
   meconium specimens are screened with test strips.

EX The coexistence of cystic fibrosis and coeliac disease has recently
   been reported, and it has been suggested that cystic fibrosis may
   predispose to the later development of coeliac disease.  The
   diagnosis of coeliac disease is largely dependent upon the
   demonstration of histological changes in the small intestine, but
   jejunal biopsy may be distressing to a small child.  It is
   suggested that food protein antibody studies may be of value in the
   investigation of children with cystic fibrosis in whom gluten
   sensitivity is suspected.  In the following case the decision to
   perform a jejunal biopsy was made when these studies were positive.
   Food protein antibody to cereal antigens, wheat, oatmeal, and
   gluten, and to ruminant antigens, cow's milk, and calf serum were
   persistently detected in the patient's blood.  Jejunal biopsy
   showed partial villous atrophy with shortening, broadening, and
   branching of the villi.  There was a satisfactory clinical
   improvement after gluten restriction.

EX Neonatal peritonitis remains a dangerous condition.  Factors
   complicating diagnosis and management include its low incidence, the
   diversity of aetiological factors found, and the severity of
   underlying or associated disease.  28 cases presenting since 1957 at
   Southmead General Hospital were reviewed.  Thirteen aetiological
   factors relating to mother or baby were found.  13 infants were
   premature, 10 had severe respiratory problems at birth.  Maternal
   hydramnios was present in 7.  6 babies had had exchange transfusion.
   The commonest findings were gangrenous volvulus and cystic fibrosis.
   Combined factors were often present.  The usual presentation is with
   bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass normal
   meconium.  4 cases had distended abdomens at birth.  Plain abdominal
   x-rays are of great diagnostic value.  Pneumoperitoneum is diagnostic
   but absent from early films.  Treatment is surgical.  Close liaison
   with the paediatrician who sees the baby first is essential.  In
   assessing results it is pointed out that many of these babies are
   small and/or suffering from serious conditions such as haemolytic
   disease, cystic fibrosis, or gangrenous volvulus.  8 cases were
   considered unfit for surgery.  Of 20 submitted to surgery, 12
   survived, mostly in the latter part of the series.

EX The Orion skin chloride measuring system had been evaluated in
   children of various ages.  The method was found to give
   reproducible results in nearly all cases.  Failure to obtain
   reproducibility was related to inadequate sweating by the subject
   and this was most likely to occur in the first week of life.  There
   was generally a clear distinction between healthy children and
   patients with cystic fibrosis.  The method was simple and reliable
   provided that the operator had had reasonable experience with the
   instrument.  One distinct advantage of the method compared with the
   use of filter paper was the speed with which results were obtained.
   The design of the instrument made the method completely safe and
   only a few patients noticed slight tingling during iontophoresis.
   The mean sweat chloride in the 'normals' was 26.9 mEq/l., compared
   with 102.3 mEq/l. in the patients with cystic fibrosis.

AB The value of detecting albumin in meconium as a screening
   procedure for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been assessed on 34,228
   samples in South Wales and North Staffordshire over a 4-year period;
   simultaneously, four methods of detecting albumin were evaluated.
   12 cases of CF were detected, detection rate being 60%.  The
   incidence of the disease in the population screened was 1 in 1850,
   confirmed by clinical and other test procedures.  Cases of CF
   without impairment of pancreatic function are likely to be missed
   by screening methods which depend on the presence of albumin in
   meconium.

EX For Caucasians of European origin, cystic fibrosis (CF) remains the
   commonest recognized autosomal recessive disorder, but it appears to
   be a rarity among the coloured races.  For a time, records may have
   suggested an association between CF and whiteness; in recent years,
   however, instance of CF children have been described whose racial
   origins are Negroid, Mongoloid, and non-European Caucasoid.  The
   present case reports concern 3 Pakistani children born in Birmingham,
   in whom Cf has been confirmed.  2 of the 3 (Cases 1 and 2) were
   brother and sister.  The present incidence of this disease among
   Asian immigrants in the West Midlands is approximately 1:10,000.

   standing in vitro, from amorphous calcium phosphate globules to
   stellar clusters of hydroxyapatite crystals.  Amorphous globules
   appeared to form at regular nucleation points on a fine network of
   unknown nature.  Hydroxyapatite crystal formation was confirmed by
   electron diffraction pattern and chemical solubility.

AB Paneth cell metaplasia is a variable feature of diverse diseases of
   the colon and rectum.  Paneth cells are numerous in the atrophic
   mucosa of chronic ulcerative colitis, in some juvenile polyps, and
   around colloid (mucinous) carcinomas.  Moderate numbers of Paneth
   cells are found in cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, ambeic colitis,
   and in villous adenomas.  Paneth cells are sparse in diverticulitis,
   in adenomatous polyps, and around nonmucinous carcinomas.  In this
   study, Paneth cell metaplasia is associated with mucus
   hypersecretion and mucin deposits.  It is suggested that one
   function of the Paneth cell is to control gastrointestinal mucin
   viscosity.

AB The effects of cystic fibrosis on 50 Victorian families with one or
   more affected children were examined in a study carried out between
   August 1972 and February 1973.  The social and emotional problems
   experienced by family members, particularly the patients and
   mothers, are reported on.  At all ages, socially embarrassing
   symptoms and awareness of being different create major problems for
   the patient.  The uncertainty of prognosis and doubts about the
   prospects of employment are specially relevant for the teenager.
   It is suggested that the patient be given ample opportunity, from
   early adolescence onward, to discuss all aspects of his disease,
   and that more appropriate provision should be made for the total
   care of adult patients.  Many problems, such as depression, feelings
   of isolation and the physical demands of constant treatment, which
   the parents of children with cystic fibrosis experience, are
   probably similar to those confronting parents of other chronically
   ill and handicapped children.  But special difficulties stem from
   the genetic basis of cystic fibrosis and from the knowledge of an
   eventually fatal outcome.  The roles of professional members of the
   medical team are touched on, particularly in relation to genetic
   counseling and the provision of practical and emotional support to
   parents.  Comments are made on the establishment of lay
   organisations.  The financial strain associated with obtaining
   regular medical attention was looked at, and suggestions are made
   for minimizing the economic problems of certain vulnerable families.

AB Cultured lymphoid cells of both homozygotes and heterozygotes for
   cystic fibrosis could be distinguished from those of normals by (1)
   growth pattern, gross clumping, and (2) a relative increase in
   dermatan sulfate, with a normal total mucopolysaccharide content.
   Lines derived from the genetic mucopolysaccharidoses also had these
   characteristics, but their total mucopolysaccharide content was
   markedly increased.  These observations support the hypothesis that
   the cellular disturbance in cystic fibrosis resides in those
   cellular regions whose functions would be altered by
   mucopolysaccharide composition.

EX Hereditary abnormalities of intestinal transport are rare conditions
   but are of disproportionate importance because of the information
   they give regarding the mechanisms of intestinal absorption in man.
   The main disability is usually diarrhoea, but there may be
   abnormalities from lack of absorption of an essential nutrient or
   occasionally from absorption of compounds in excess due to failure
   of a normal control mechanism.  These diseases are experiments of
   nature which cannot be exactly simulated in the laboratory animal,
   and thus may on occasions give information unobtainable from other
   sources.  Most often, however, they confirm that the mechanisms of
   absorption studied in detail in smaller mammals are probably
   applicable to man.  In some of these diseases there is an associated
   defect of transport in the proximal renal tubules as well as in the
   gut.  They furnish evidence, therefore, that transport processes are
   closely related in the gut and in the kidney, or at least that an
   important step in transport is identical at the two sites.  Such
   disorders include disorders of carbohydrate absorption, hereditary
   defects of amino acid absorption, hereditary defects in the
   absorption of fat, hereditary disorders of the intestinal absorption
   of electrolytes, and hereditary defects of vitamin B12 absorption.

AB Elasticity of sputum.  Elasticity of sputum has been determined
   using the Weissenberg rheogoniometer, by oscillatory testing, over
   frequencies from 0.01 to 0.8 c/s.  Sputum was from patients with
   either asthma, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, or
   bronchiectasis and, macroscopically, mucoid, mucopurulent or
   purulent.  As in the viscosity plot over this shear rate range two
   Zones with a junctional region can be distinguished.  In Zone 1,
   over the lowest shear rates, elasticity increases slowly, changes
   little over a "plateau" region and then, in Zone 2, increases
   sharply.  In contrast to the viscosity plot, the plateau does not
   show nothing.  By 0.8 c/s some samples show decreasing elasticity.
   Although variance between samples is wide, there is no level of
   elasticity characteristic of each disease or of one macroscopic
   appearance.  Elasticity and viscosity are correlated, most
   significantly at the lowest shear rates.  Asthmatic and
   bronchiectatic sputa resemble each other in that this correlation
   is still significant at higher shear rates, cystic fibrosis and
   chronic bronchitic sputum in that it is not.  Since in these last
   two mucous gland hypertrophy is present, it may be that the sputum
   has a higher mucus component.

AB Concentrations of immunoglobulins were determined (using Mancini
   method and WHO standard) in 108 sera taken during long term
   treatment of 45 children with C.F. from 2 months to 16 years old.
   They were shown to depend markedly on the clinical state of the
   children particularly on the presence of pulmonary tract infectious
   processes.  These infections caused a rise in immunoglobulin
   concentration with predominance of IgM in C.F. children aged up to 3
   yrs, and with predominance of IgG in older children.  Mean titer of
   isohemagglutinins in children with C.F. was higher than in healthy
   children.  Low titers of diphtherial and stapholococcal antibodies
   were found.  In the case of anti diphtheria antibodies, this can be
   attributed to the fact that these children are not regularly
   vaccinated owing to their poor clinical condition.  As to the low
   titer of antistaphylococcal antibodies this is a well known finding
   in the course of chronic staphylococcal infections of appropriate
   bacteriological tests in our C.F. children.  Furthermore their
   lymphocytes showed an increased blastic transformation when
   stimulated with staphylococcal filtrate.  Transformation of
   PHA-stimulated lymphocytes was normal.

AB A cross-over trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy has
   been conducted on 12 children with cystic fibrosis using Pancrex V
   forte and Nutrizym tablets in equivalent dosage.  No differences
   were found in the effectiveness of these products as measured by
   stool volume, number of bowel actions, faecal fat excretion, and
   urine urea excretion.  Neither product eliminated the steatorrhoea.
   Though there was no laboratory evidence to support their choice nine
   patients expressed a preference for Nutrizym at the conclusion of
   the trial.  This preference was based partly on the smaller number
   of tablets which are required.

AB In an attempt to retard deterioration of pulmonary function, a
   young man with cystic fibrosis underwent broncho-pulmonary
   lavage of an entire lung.  In spite of theoretical advantages, the
   lavage produced an acute deterioration in the patient's clinical and
   physiologic status, from which he had not recovered one month later.
   We conclude that bronchopulmonary lavage in cystic fibrosis may be
   hazardous and should be reserved for those cases in which
   conventional methods of improving tracheobronchial clearance have
   failed.

AB The biochemical properties of the erythrocyte membrane have been
   studied in cystic fibrosis patients and in age-matched controls.  No
   significant differences could be observed in either the
   concentration or composition of the principal membrane constituents.
   Contrary to previous reports, we found normal levels of the
   Mg2+-dependent and Ca2+ + Mg2+-dependent ATPase activities in CF
   preparations.  However, a qualitative difference was observed in the
   Ca2+-dependent ATPase, since the enzyme had relatively greater
   activity at lower calcium concentrations in the cystic preparations.
   This effect on the membrane-bound Ca2+-ATPase is unlikely to
   represent a genetic defect in the enzyme itself but it may be
   connected with the mechanism of pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis.

AB The levels and properties of microsomal glycoprotein
   galactosyltransferase of cultured skin fibroblasts from control and
   cystic fibrosis patients were investigated using bovine submaxillary
   gland mucin as the exogenous acceptor.  Although the mean specific
   activity of this enzyme was higher tin cystic fibrosis fibroblasts,
   the difference was not significant.  The properties of the enzyme as
   regards pH optimum, metal ion and Triton X-100 requirement, apparent
   Km, heat stability and nucleotide/sugar-nucleotide response were
   similar for control and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts.

AB Various aspects of the immune status were examined in patients with
   cystic fibrosis (CF) and the following observations were made.  Ten
   per cent of the CF patients had elevated or reduced serum IgG
   concentrations and there seems to be a transient low serum IgA
   concentration in the same number.  Serum IgM concentrations were
   normal in CF patients.  Normal levels of the three serum
   immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA and IgM) were detected in the siblings and
   heterozygotes.  Serum IgE concentrations were elevated in 32% of
   patients with CF but normal concentrations were detected in
   heterozygotes and siblings.  Precipitating antibodies to various
   antigens and allergens were detected in the sputum of most patients
   with CF, but their sera contained lower or undetectable titres of
   these antibodies.  The precipitating antibodies in CF sputum to
   bacteria, to agar, to seminal fluid, to urine and to human serum may
   be related to a common antigenic determinant of the glycoproteins
   present in all these fluids.  The total protein concentration in the
   sputum of CF patients seemed to reflect the extent of lung damage.
   The third component (C3) of serum complement concentration was
   normal, or moderately elevated in all CF patients tested.  Serum
   transferrin concentrations were normal in CF patients but their
   prealbumin levels were depressed, suggesting marginal

EX In order to differentiate asthma from other disorders resembling it,
   one should attempt to define clearly what we mean by asthma and
   wheezing.  A most simplistic statement would define asthma as a
   recurring form of dyspnea marked by wheezing breath sounds.  The
   incompleteness of this definition is apparent: asthma is really a
   symptom complex of labored wheezing breathing, characterized by
   hyperreactivity of the bronchi to various stimuli, resulting in
   generalized narrowing of the airways, variable in scope, and often
   reversible by sympathomimetics, theophylline derivatives, and
   corticosteroids.  A variety of conditions must be considered when
   studying the wheezing child.  These include asthmatic bronchitis,
   acute bronchitis, spasmodic croup, allergic cough, habit cough,
   foreign body, cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis), right middle lobe
   syndrome, and upper and lower respiratory tract conditions simulating
   asthma.

   Early recognition and treatment of "diabetes" in children with
   cystic fibrosis is emphasized.

EX Chronic sinusitis in young children does not often invoke "sinus"
   complaints of fullness, discomfort, or pain over the affected sinus,
   for it is only the older child who verbalizes these complaints.
   Rather, it is the secondary signs and symptoms that lead the
   physician to suspect this entity in children.  The most common of
   these are chronic nasal discharge and chronic nasal obstruction.  A
   careful nasal examination is essential for the recognition of chronic
   sinusitis, the most common predecessor of chronic sinusitis.
   Allergic rhinitis is probably the second most common background of
   acute and then chronic sinusitis.  Chronic sinusitis in children with
   cystic fibrosis is a characteristic finding.  Sinusitis is common in
   cleft lip and cleft palate children.  Infants and children with
   clinical signs of chronic infection and radiographic changes should
   have a nose culture and sensitivity studies to plan appropriate
   antibiotic therapy.  Surgical therapy is indicated when the symptoms,
   such as chronic pain, chronic otitis media, chronic bronchitis,
   orbital infections, or intracranial complications, occur.

AB Sera from 31 of 146 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) contained
   levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) which were elevated by
   age-related criteria.  Prominent liver isoenzyme bands were present
   after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of all 31 abnormal sera.
   Larger than normal amounts of bone and intestinal AP were not
   present in these sera.  These findings indicate that liver
   abnormalities consistently are responsible for elevations of total
   AP in sera of patients with CF.  Several causes of high liver AP
   levels in CF patients were identified: chronic hepatic congestion,
   drug hepatotoxicity, overt biliary cirrhosis, and most commonly
   subclinical focal biliary cirrhosis.

EX "Asthma," according to the United States National Tuberculosis
   Association, "is a disease characterized by an increased
   responsiveness of the trachea and bronchi to various stimuli, and
   made manifest by difficulty of breathing due to generalized narrowing
   of the airways.  This narrowing is dynamic and changes in degree,
   either spontaneously or because of therapy.  The basic defect appears
   to be an altered state of the host."  The maxim, "All that wheezes is
   not asthma," justifiably reinforces the importance of differential
   diagnosis; indeed, the characteristic features of asthma may be found
   to some degree in a wide variety of chest conditions or general
   systemic diseases.  The purposes of this monograph are to review
   those conditions that may be confused with asthma and to focus
   attention on the specific points of importance in the history,
   physical examination and laboratory test results that might provide
   clues to the final diagnosis.

AB Six patients having exacerbations of chronic pulmonary infections in
   association with cystic fibrosis were treated with intramuscular
   tobramycin 5 mg./kg./day in 3 divided doses.  The eight treatment
   courses lasted 9 to 30 days.  Mean serum levels were 2.5 microg./ml.
   at 1 to 3 hours and 0.2 microg./ml. at 7 1/2 to 8 hours after a dose
   of tobramycin.  The mean tobramycin concentration in sputum was 0.3
   microg./ml.  Eighty-two percent of the 66 pathogenic bacterial
   isolates from sputum were either Pseudomonas sp. (64%) or
   Staphylococcus aureus (18%).  Ninety-seven percent of Pseudomonas
   sp. and 83 percent of Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1
   microg. tobramycin per ml.  No organism that was isolated before
   therapy was observed to become resistant to tobramycin, although on
   3 occasions colonization with new resistant gram-negative bacilli
   occurred.  In 6 out of 8 courses of therapy patients showed clinical
   improvement.  Elimination of bacterial pathogens from the sputum was
   rarely achieved and was not necessary to produce clinical
   improvement.  Colonization with resistant flora was an uncommon
   finding.  Tobramycin's side effects were limited to local discomfort

AB Serum proteins have been studied by means of paper electrophoresis
   in 88 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and correlated with
   bacteriological lung findings.  An increase of all serum globulin
   fractions in CF patients was found, whereas albumin and
   albumin/globulin ratio were decreased.  The changes in all serum
   protein fractions were significantly greater in patients with
   constant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the lungs than in
   patients without this constant infection (p < 0.005), whereas
   patients with intermittent pseudomonas infection did not have more
   severe changes than patients without pseudomonas infection.  The
   changes in gamma-globulin and total globulin were significantly
   greater in patients with frequent Staphylococcus aureus infections
   than in patients with rare Staphylococcus aureus infections (p <
   0.005 and p < 0.05, respectively).  As regards the other serum
   protein fractions, no significant differences between patients with
   frequent and rare staphylococcus infections were found.  Judged by
   simple scoring systems, the lung disease of patients with constant
   pseudomonas infection was significantly more progressed clinically
   and radiologically than that of patients without constant
   pseudomonas infection (p < 0.00005), whereas no significant
   differences were found between the other patient groups.

EX Few studies of serum proteins by means of paper electrophoresis in
   patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have been published.  In these
   studies alterations of the serum protein fractions were found, some
   of which were significantly correlated with the clinical and
   radiological severity of the disease.  In the present study, serum
   proteins determined by paper electrophoresis in 95 patients with CF
   have been studied and correlated with clinical and radiological
   findings.  The serum proteins and electrophoretic patterns if 95
   patients with CF were followed for 1 to 6 years in each patient.  For
   CF patients as a whole, total serum protein was unchanged, whereas
   albumin and albumin/globulin ratio were decreased and all globulin
   fractions increased.  Total serum protein was increased in patients
   with severe pulmonary disease.  The changes in total serum protein
   and in all protein fractions were significantly correlated with
   clinical and radiological severity of the lung disease.  All terminal
   patients had severe changes.  Patients with complicating liver
   cirrhosis had electrophoretic patterns that did not differ from those
   of other CF patients.  It is concluded that the main cause for serum
   protein alterations in CF is the lung affection, whereas liver
   involvement and malabsorption probably are of much less importance.

AB The main characteristic of patients with cystic fibrosis is lung
   involvement; the fatal outcome of the disease is most often due to
   pulmonary complications.  Since the paper by West et al. (1954) on
   pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis, the importance of lung
   function studies in this disorder has been stressed in several
   publications.  We have studied lung function in a number of children
   and young adults with cystic fibrosis.  The results have been
   correlated with clinical, radiological, and bacteriological
   findings.

AB An investigation of sweat chloride with chloride electrode Orion 417
   in normal persons and in patients with cystic fibrosis.  Sweat
   chloride values examined with Orion 417 direct-reading skin
   electrode were collected in a group of 811 normal persons and a
   group of 91 patients with cystic fibrosis and were evaluated for
   differences attributable to age and sex.  In the normal group no
   significant difference was found between the two sexes.  In the
   normal group the values among newborns are found to be considerably
   higher than in the rest of childhood.  During the first month of
   life the values decrease to a steady level, which is maintained from
   the age of 1 month to 15 years.  After the age of 15 a steady
   increase takes place.  With data gathered from the normal group we
   propose the following upper limits of "normal" for the sweat
   chloride test: 1 month - 15 years: Chloride 40 meq/l.  16 - 25
   years: Chloride 55 meq/l.  Upon examination of the Cystic Fibrosis
   group, the sweat chloride values in all age groups were found to be
   above the upper limits of normal.  The method is found valuable for
   large scale screening purposes for Cystic Fibrosis.

AB Using pH-microelectrodes the excretion of hydrogen-ions and
   bicarbonate in relation to flow rate was investigated in a single
   sweat gland of cystic fibrosis children.  The results show decreased
   excretion of hydrogen-ions and an increased excretion of
   bicarbonate.  Evidence is presented that due to reduced secretion of
   hydrogen-ions in the duct both the reabsorption of sodium and the
   secretion of potassium may be impaired.  Reduced flux of protons
   across the luminal membrane of epithelial cells is proposed as a
   general feature of exocrine gland defects.  It is then possible to
   describe both the cationic transport defect of the sweat gland duct
   and the anionic bicarbonate-secretory defect in one term.

EX Since 1900 improvements in general hygiene, and the development of
   antibiotic therapy have enabled many of the epidemic infectious
   diseases, particularly those of infancy and early childhood,
   increasingly to be controlled.  In contrast, the morbidity and
   mortality of diseases of genetic origin have been little affected.
   The rational use of cell culture as an investigative technique in
   inherited metabolic disease is rooted in the simple biologic truth
   that, since a full complement of chromosomes is present in all
   somatic cells, it should be possible to detect the specific
   biochemical consequences of gene activity in cultured fibroblasts
   unless, during the process of differentiation, genes are irreversibly
   inactivated.  The usefulness of tissue culture in investigating
   inherited metabolic disease does not rest with the biochemical
   identification of the primary defect.  The cells in culture provide a
   model system of the disease, which can be used to test the possible
   effectiveness of therapeutic agents.  Tissue culture techniques
   indicated that the cells derived from patients with cystic fibrosis
   showed metachromasia.  Although the isolation and characterization of
   cystic fibrosis from cystic fibrosis serum has not been accomplished,
   a number of properties have been described.

AB 43 children with cystic fibrosis, of whom 16 had not received
   pancreatic extracts, were investigated hematologically.  No
   difference was observed in mean hemoglobin and serum iron levels and
   bone marrow non hemoglobin iron between patients receiving and those
   not receiving pancreatic enzymes.  A significant proportion of
   children in both groups were found to have mild iron deficiency.
   These findings are in agreement with the view that pancreatic
   insufficiency does not increase iron absorption.

AB It is estimated that cystic fibrosis affects approximately one of
   every 2,000 white children born in the United States, and is now
   generally regarded as the commonest serious metabolic disorder of
   white children with the exception of diabetes mellitus.  Its
   occurrence in children of Afro-Americans is quite rare and
   exceedingly so in those of Oriental extraction.  Since cystic
   fibrosis is genetically determined as an autosomal recessive trait,
   and since the obligate heterozygote parent is entirely asymptomatic,
   the disease on its first occurrence in a given family can only be
   suspected by its manifestations in the patient himself.  At present
   there is no test available for the detection of cystic fibrosis
   which can be applied as a simple, practical screening test, such as
   is available for phenylketonuria.  Diagnostic tests are, therefore,
   used to confirm or refute the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis when
   suggestive symptoms arise or when a sibling or relative is known to
   have the disease.

AB This paper describes investigations on the absorption of
   3-methoxyphenyl-L-alanine (anisylalanine) in normal subjects,
   children with cystic fibrosis and in one child with Hartnup disease.
   Anisylalanine was slowly metabolised mainly to acetyl anisylalanine,
   and p-methoxyphenyl-pyruvic acid and lactic acids which were
   excreted.  In normal adult subjects anisylalanine (25 mg/kg body
   weight) was rapidly absorbed, maximum plasma concentrations being
   obtained 0.5-1.0 hour after ingestion.  Thereafter the plasma
   concentration declined exponentially.  In the group of eight
   children with cystic fibrosis, the maximum plasma concentration
   was lower than observed in the control group, and was delayed.  A
   very poor response was observed in an infant with Hartnup disorder.

EX Cord serum, amniotic fluid and meconium of a newborn from a
   heterozygote (PiZZ) mother were investigated.  In the newborn infant
   the diagnosis of homozygote (PiZZ) deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin
   could be established in cord serum at the time of delivery.  Trypsin
   inhibitory capacity (TIC) and alpha1-antitrypsin (AT) in cord serum
   were in the range of adult homozygotes.  By means of crossed
   immunoelectrophoresis exclusively, the phenotypic alleles ZZ were
   demonstrable.  This excludes the possibility of materno-fetal
   transfer of alpha1-antitrypsin.  In infant amniotic fluid extremely
   low antiprotease-activity and substantially no alpha1-antitrypsin was
   found, whereas in normal samples the TIC is 3% to 6% of the cord
   serum values and the AT 1.2% to 4% of cord serum concentration.  Our
   data suggest that a major component of TIC and AT in normal amniotic
   fluid derive from the fetus.  In normal meconium we detected TIC and
   AT in concentrations increasing proportionally to the total protein
   content.  The inhibitory capacity of AT in meconium expressed in mg
   trypsin inhibited per mg alpha1-antitrypsin however is 80% less than
   serum alpha1-antitrypsin.  No correlation exists with the free
   tryptic activity of meconium.  The AT of an PiZZ infant is clearly
   diminished when referred to fresh weight, whereas meconia from three
   cystic fibrosis newborns screened by the BM test had extremely high
   concentrations.  Estimation of TIC and AT in meconium is regarded as
   a useful approach for screening on homozygote alpha1-antitrypsin
   deficiency.  The exact diagnosis however can only be established by
   phenotyping the alleles.  In cystic fibrosis the high protein content
   of meconium is accompanied by increased alpha1-antitrypsin levels.

EX The purpose of this communication is to discuss how the application
   of one methodology - the study of the cultured human cell - has added
   insight into understanding the genetic reasons for such disparate
   clinical phenotypes.  A mutant genotype not recognizable and/or
   understandable in vivo can often be recognized in vitro by studying
   the metabolism and morphological characteristics of the cultured
   cell.  Two syndromes will be used as illustrations of this principle
   - the genetic mucopolysaccharidoses and cystic fibrosis.  The
   patients described were selected to demonstrate how the use of cell
   culture adds insight into the diagnosis of human genetic disorders.
   The study of the cultured human cell has and will aid in advancing
   our ability to diagnose human genetic disorders.

AB Admissions to hospital in the Republic of Ireland, in Scotland, and
   in England and Wales for coeliac disease and cystic fibrosis are
   compared.  Admissions to hospital in 1972 for coeliac disease in the
   Republic of Ireland - which does not yet have full returns of
   hospital admissions - was approximately three times greater than the
   number expected based upon the rates in England and Wales in
   1969-71.  In Scotland the admission rates for coeliac disease were
   about twice the expected number based upon the English rates.  This
   contrasted with admissions for cystic fibrosis which were only
   slightly higher in Ireland and in Scotland than in England and
   Wales - evidence that the high admission rates for coeliac disease
   represent a genuinely high rate in the community.  Admission rates
   for coeliac disease were as high in the East and South of Ireland as
   in the West.  In Ireland, the potato, and not the wheaten bread, was
   the staple diet before the great famine of the 1840s.  In
   nineteenth-century Scotland, too, less wheaten bread was eaten than
   in England and Wales.  In the past, therefore, coeliac disease
   would not be as disadvantageous in Ireland, and to a less extent in
   Scotland, as in England and Wales.

AB The cytoplasmic metachromasia phenomenon with Toluidine Blue 0 in
   cultured skin fibroblasts was studied in 12 parents of children with
   cystic fibrosis and in 12 controls.  Positive findings were recorded
   in 10 of the CF parents and in one of the controls.  The average
   culture time required for development of maximum metachromasia in
   positive cases was six weeks.  The possible significance of the
   ametachromatic CF patients in relation to the suggested genetic
   heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis is discussed.

AB Forty-six deciduous teeth from 17 children with cystic fibrosis who
   had a recorded history of tetracycline therapy were sectioned
   vertically and horizontally.  Teeth in three representative
   staining categories (mild, moderate, and severe) were photographed
   under visible and ultraviolet illumination to determine the extent
   of tetracycline incorporation into tooth enamel and dentin.
   Tetracycline incorporation into enamel was minimal or nonexistent,
   whereas tetracycline incorporation into dentin was always observed.
   The severity of general surface discoloration was directly related
   to the proximity of the tetracycline incorporation to the
   dentinoenamel junction.  This was dependent on dosage, duration, and
   period of initiation of tetracycline therapy as it related to
   odontogenesis.  Critical periods to avoid tetracycline therapy and
   thereby to minimize potential tooth discoloration were determined.

EX Screening an apparently healthy population for metabolic disorders
   raises many ethical problems.  It is necessary to differentiate
   clearly between screening programmes of a service nature and those
   which are really research projects.  Screening for phenylketonuria,
   histidinaemia, galactosaemia, cystic fibrosis, Tay-and Sachs disease
   are discussed.  These disorders demonstrate some of the advantages
   and undoubtedly difficult problems which screening presents.  It is
   essential that no one should lose sight of the fact that the aim of
   screening is to help the individual and the community.  The
   psychological aspects of screening are very important and continuing
   thought must be given to the fact that biochemical abnormalities do
   not necessarily equate with disease.

TI Standardization of a new minor salivary gland collecting procedure
   for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
SO J-Dent-Child. 1974 Nov-Dec. 41(6). P 461-4.

EX The objective of this investigation was to further refine a technique
   developed to serve as a new test procedure for the diagnosis of
   cystic fibrosis of the pancreas utilizing a more quantitative
   approach for measuring, in a standard fashion, the volume of
   secretion of the minor salivary glands of the lower labial mucosa,
   which can be collected over a fixed period of time.  It was also
   hoped that such standardization would facilitate the more accurate
   study of all aspects of study of minor salivary gland secretion
   collected in this fashion.  From the findings, it is obvious that
   less minor salivary gland secretion was collected from cystic
   fibrosis patients than from normal control subjects, using a
   capillary tube test.  This may be due, in part, to an increased
   viscosity of minor-salivary-gland saliva in cystic fibrosis.
   Unfortunately, viscosity studies were beyond the scope of this
   investigation.  The results indicate that the relative differences
   between the volume of minor salivary secretion collected at a
   standard test site and that collected over the total lower labial
   mucosa are similar.  The volumetric differences in minor salivary
   secretion have again been found to be distinctive enough to suggest
   that studies be continued in this area to further refine a diagnostic
   test procedure for cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.  At the present
   time, studies are in progress to measure the volume of minor salivary
   secretion at a standard test site employing an electronic technique.
   It is hoped that this approach may permit the elimination of
   viscosity as a variable.

AB Intracisternal granules (Palade, 1956) or inclusion bodies occurring
   within the cisternae of the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum
   have been observed not only in normal conditions, but also in some
   experimental conditions.  In this paper, such intracisternal
   inclusion bodies were induced or found in a variety of animals
   following chemical administrations, artificial hibernation and cold
   exposure, and also with cystic fibrosis.  These inclusion bodies are
   tentatively classified into 6 types based upon their morphological
   aspects.  The formation, fate and significance of these bodies are
   also discussed.

AB Over the last 10 years, pyocin typing has been a useful tool for the
   epidemiological fingerprinting of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  The
   widely used "scrape-and-streak" method of Gillies and Govan,
   although simple to perform, has not been sensitive enough in
   differentiation of strains.  Use of additional indicator strains
   might correct this deficiency.  The "growth-in-broth" method of
   typing has shown promise; because it is easily automated, it may
   become the method of choice when very sensitive results are
   required.  The value of pyocin typing appears to be well established
   in the study of nosocomial infections; however, in some situations
   it may give misleading results.  Further studies are required for
   demonstration of the relative value and relationships of
   serological, pyocin, and bacteriophage typing.

AB Study of the humoral antibody response of patients with cystic
   fibrosis to the heat-stable O (and possibly K) antigens of
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed that these antibodies in
   significant titers do not lead to eradication of the microorganism
   from the respiratory tract.  In three out of six patients,
   antibodies directed against the strains isolated from both sputum
   and the lungs at autopsy were present in elevated titers.  The
   antibody response to P. aeruginosa is strikingly affected by the
   condition of the host and differs in patients with cystic fibrosis
   or with one or another kind of malignancy.

AB Various techniques have been utilized for measurement of antibodies
   against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  In general, the results of such
   measurements tend to parallel each other, but the principal
   functional antibodies against Pseudomonas appear to be opsonins of
   the IgG and IgM immunoglobulin classes.  These antibodies are
   potentiated by the complement system, activated either through the
   "classical" or "alternate" pathways.  Susceptibility to fatal
   infection with Pseudomonas is associated with antibody deficiency,
   but this defect is usually correlated with other data regarding the
   state of the host, such as underlying disease, immunosuppressive
   therapy, and functional leukopenia.  Additional information is
   needed on the relative protective role of IgG and IgM antibodies,
   the affinity of such antibodies for viable bacteria, and the role of
   antibodies against nonlipopolysaccharide antigens, such as protein
   components of the cell wall and Pseudomonas exotoxins.

AB A heptavalent lipopolysaccharide vaccine against Pseudomonas has
   been developed.  Clinical trials revealed a decreased incidence of
   sepsis and mortality due to Pseudomonas in vaccinated patients with
   burns.  If vaccinated, certain groups of immunosuppressed patients
   with cancer may also have a decreased incidence of death associated
   with Pseudomonas.  Trials of parenteral vaccination in patients with
   cystic fibrosis show little benefit.  Adverse reactions to this
   vaccine are frequent and often limit the dose given.

EX We examined white cell cultures from 45 parents of CF patients (ie,
   compulsory heterozygotes) to confirm if possible the existence of
   an ametachromatic group (class III0 and the quantitate this class
   in relation to the numbers of heterozygotes showing vesicular
   cytoplasmic metachromasia (class I0 and generalized metachromasia
   (class II).  Leucocyte cultures from the 45 CF carriers were set up
   in parallel with similar cultures from 45 normal healthy controls.
   The results confirm the value of the Toluidine Blue O metachromasia
   phenomenon in white cell cultures as a method for heterozygote
   detection in cystic fibrosis and suggest that it may be justified
   to replace the tedious, expensive and time-consuming fibroblast
   technique with the much simpler and more rapid leukocyte culture
   procedure.  The simplicity and apparent reliability of the
   leukocyte culture procedure as outlined here should facilitate
   intrafamilial investigation and co-ordination of metachromasia
   class with other parameters such as sweat electrolytes, ciliary
   dyskinetic factor and clinical manifestations.  Such a study, if it
   revealed distinct and consistent phenotypic correlations, might
   furnish valuable additional evidence for genetic heterogeneity in
   cystic fibrosis.

EX This brief review emphasizes the paradox of cystic fibrosis.  A
   plethora of abnormalities have been disclosed yet none can be
   accorded the pride of place as the primary inherited abnormality.
   It is nevertheless hoped that in the near future, as a result of
   collaboration and integration of highly specialized areas of
   research, meaningful and significant data can be obtained which will
   ultimately be of value not only in identifying heterozygotes with
   this condition but also in the handling and treatment of patients
   with this common and disabling inherited disease.

AB Suspensions of Proteus vulgaris were rapidly agglutinated by serum
   from cystic fibrosis patients.  Serum from obligate heterozygotes
   exhibited a mean agglutination time that was significantly less than
   that observed for 128 controls.  The agglutinating property was
   observed to be transmitted through several generations and through
   both maternal and paternal branches of the pedigrees.  Qualitative
   differences were noted, with CF sera inducing the formation of
   clumps that were two- to 10-fold larger than those observed in
   heterozygotes.  The serum factor responsible for P. vulgaris
   agglutination was heat sensitive, destroyed by pronase, and
   neutralized by anti-human whole serum.  The CF serum retained
   agglutinating activity following preincubation with anti-human IgG,
   IgA, B1E, and B1A/B1C.

AB A strain of Staphylococcus aureus (no. FAR4) has been isolated from
   a patient at frequent intervals over 18 months.  This strain has
   previously been shown to lose resistance to several antibodies
   (Lacey et al., 1973); during the last 6 months further changes have
   occurred in it in vivo.  Lincomycin resistance appeared after the
   patient had been treated with clindamycin.  This was due to mutation
   to constitutive resistance to both lincomycin and erythromycin at a
   locus adjacent to that determining "inducible" resistance to
   erythromycin.  Both loci are probably carried by an extrachromosomal
   element.  Three types of variation in the PF plasmid were observed.
   Alteration in production of penicillinase from macroconstitutive to
   microconstitutive, was not associated with any detectable change in
   plasmid size.  This change gave the cell an advantage in vitro,
   because it was associated with a faster growth rate and probably
   also in vivo, because the microconstitutive variants were isolated
   in increasing numbers after flucloxacillin therapy had ceased.
   Complete loss of determinants for penicillinase production and for
   resistance to cadmium ions from the PF plasmid was associated with a
   decrease in plasmid size of about 4 x 10 6 daltons.  This change was
   also associated with increased growth rate in vitro.  Loss of
   resistance to fusidic acid from the PF plasmid was associated with a
   decrease in plasmid size of about 1 x 10 6 daltons.

   METHODS.
AB A method suitable for the study of regional lung function in
   children is described.  The method is simple to perform, takes only
   2 min, and provides pictorial and numerical information on regional
   ventilation and perfusion and a scaling factor measured after
   rebreathing to account for regional variation in lung size and
   shielding.  Although the availability of a computer system such as
   the one described in the text is essential for precise and rapid
   numerical evaluation, nuclear medicine laboratories that lack this
   facility but have a gamma camera could use this method to obtain
   scintigraphic information alone.

EX Staphylococcal empyema is not a rare occurrence in patients with
   cystic fibrosis, occurring in as many as 4.5 per cent of such
   patients in our recent experience.  In some patients, it may be the
   presenting illness in infancy.  Cystic fibrosis patients with empyema
   now constitute a significant percentage (approximately 3 to 7 per
   cent) of the total number of patients hospitalized with empyema.
   Since most of these empyemas occur in infancy and most are of
   staphylococcal origin, sweat tests should be done on all infants
   admitted with staphylococcal pneumonia with or without empyema,
   particularly when recovery with adequate treatment is unduly
   prolonged.

AB Fecal fat and nitrogen excretion were determined in 20 patients, 12
   to 17 years of age, with cystic fibrosis (CF); all had pancreatic
   deficiency.  Current clinical and nutritional status and growth
   achievement in relation to fecal nutrient loss, age at diagnosis,
   and adequacy of treatment were evaluated.  Steatorrhea and
   azotorrhea were present to a variable extent (at times massive) in
   all patients studied, but bore little relation to existing
   intestinal symptoms, state of nutrition, growth achieved, or age at
   diagnosis.  Many of the patients with better growth, nutrition, and
   prognostic scores had been diagnosed relatively late in life and
   presumably had not received adequate or optimal treatment.  Addition
   of pancreatic supplements resulted in significant, but not dramatic
   decreases in fecal losses of fat and nitrogen.  It was concluded
   that despite pancreatic deficiency most older patients with CF need
   little dietary restriction, although treatment should be
   individualized.  Growth failure and state of nutrition seem to be
   correlated more closely with the pulmonary state than with
   pancreatic deficiency.  For ultimate prognosis, natural variation in
   the severity of lung involvement is at least as important as early
   diagnosis and adequate or optimal treatment.

EX The recent data suggest that we can no longer use mist tents or
   intermittent aerosol therapy for cystic fibrosis patients with the
   abandon previously employed.  We cannot accept such therapy as having
   been proved to be effective.  We formerly believed aerosols and mists
   could do little harm; we now know they can be harmful.  If such
   treatment is to be used, the patient should be closely monitored
   clinically and with sensitive pulmonary function tests such as
   maximum expiratory flow volume curves.  It is obvious that we have
   much more to learn, confirm or disprove with respect to the rationale
   for and benefits of mist and aerosol therapy.

EX We have recently studied an 11-year-old child with proved cystic
   fibrosis in whom raised sweat sodium but normal sweat chloride
   levels were obtained while she was receiving cloxacillin.  There
   was no peripheral edema or hypoproteinemia, although at necropsy
   there was evidence of biliary cirrhosis.  Although the sweat
   abnormality might have been due to as yet unknown factors, the
   temporal association with cloxacillin administration suggests a
   causative relationship, and it is tempting to speculate that the
   anomaly was produced in this instance by the substitution of the
   cloxacillin radical for the chloride ion in the sweat during the
   period of therapy.  In light of our findings it would be of
   interest to know whether the infant reported by MacLean and Tripp
   was receiving any drugs at the time of the initial sweat chloride
   estimations and whether sodium estimations were also performed.

AB Pancreatic glucagon and insulin were determined in 10 children with
   cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and in a control group following stimulation
   by an arginine infusion.  In controls the infusion of arginine
   induced a prompt threefold elevation in plasma pancreatic glucagon
   and about a sixfold increase in plasma immunoreactive insulin.  In
   patients with C.F. the average response of both hormones was
   considerably less, and the base-line concentrations for glucagon
   were lower.  The data support the hypothesis that in C.F. both
   alpha- and beta-cell function are affected as a result of the
   underlying process.

AB The efficiency of delivery of an aerosol to 22 children with cystic
   fibrosis, aged 8 months to 17 years, was investigated with the use
   a standard ultrasonic nebulizer.  The study was designed to simulate
   clinical conditions as closely as possible.  Retention of the
   aerosol was monitored with a scintillation camera interfaced to a
   small digital computer.  The children also had ventilation studies
   with xenon-133, which allowed comparison of the distribution of
   aerosol with regional ventilation.  The aerosol was visualized
   within the lungs of all 22 patients.  Between 0.8 and 6.5 per cent
   of the initial activity was deposited in the lungs, representing an
   average of 0.27 ml. per therapy session or 0.0131 ml. per kilogram
   of body weight.  There was a positive correlation (r = 0.89; p <
   0.01) between increasing age and greater pulmonary deposition of the
   aerosol.  There was decreased aerosol entry to regions which were
   poorly ventilated.  The efficiency of aerosol deposition is variable
   in children with cystic fibrosis, depending primarily on the age of
   the patient, whereas its distribution within their lungs is related
   to regional variations in the severity of the pulmonary disease.

EX The recent interesting report on cystic fibrosis with edema and
   falsely negative sweat test prompted us to report a similar case.
   The previously reported similar cases and this one suggest that
   when cystic fibrosis is suspected in an edematous infant and the
   sweat chloride or sodium concentration is within the normal range,
   the test should be repeated after the edema has disappeared.

EX Twelve patients with abdominal complaints had an operation that
   included incidental appendectomy.  They were later diagnosed as
   having cystic fibrosis.  Four groups of presenting signs and symptoms
   were right lower quadrant mass, chronic abdominal pain, intestinal
   obstruction, and hepatomegaly.  In all cases the symptoms
   precipitating operation were due to the underlying unrecognized
   condition: cystic fibrosis.  Review of the histology of the appendix
   revealed the classic changes of hypersecretion of the mucous glands
   to be present.  The appendix shares in the generalized intestinal
   mucous gland involvement peculiar to cystic fibrosis.  Awareness of
   this fact has not been widespread, perhaps because of the usual
   emphasis on the pulmonary and pancreatic aspects of the disease.
   Greater appreciation of the clinical symptoms of cystic fibrosis and
   more liberal use of the sweat test could have diminished the number
   of exploratory celiotomies.  Recognition of the histoloc changes in
   the removed appendices can also suggest the proper diagnosis and lead
   to earlier institution of treatment with an improved prognosis.

AB Infants with cystic fibrosis occasionally may present with a symptom
   complex of anemia, hypoproteinemia, and edema.  Case reports of
   seven infants between the ages of 1 to 4 months who developed these
   abnormalities indicate that in several instances the children's
   condition was misdiagnosed as milk-sensitivity or milk-allergy.
   Furthermore, their case histories verify that their hypoalbuminemia
   and anemia is nutritional and is corrected when a readily absorbed
   diet with pancreatic-enzyme supplement is given.  A retrospective
   review of feeding histories of 100 infants with cystic fibrosis, as
   well as these case reports, indicate that affected children who are
   breast-fed or fed with soy-based formulas are more likely to develop
   the syndrome.

EX Since the report of an edema-anemia-hypoproteinemia symptom complex
   in infants with cystic fibrosis, several articles have been
   published.  We have also participated in the care of identical male
   twins with this interesting symptom complex.  These twins offer two
   more examples of the edema-anemia-hypoproteinemia symptom complex
   of infant cystic fibrosis.  In the presence of transsupplementation
   and the absence of hemolysis, the normal serum iron and increased
   peripheral and marrow iron values suggest that the anemia results
   from a defect at the level of hemoglobin synthesis, and that iron
   transport remains sufficient in the face of protein depletion.
   Possibly, a relative iron deficiency occurs after increased
   nutritional intake due to increased utilization.  Lee suggested
   that the hypoproteinemia is due to loss of protein in stools, but
   these twins suggest that the problem lies not with losses through
   urine or stool, but rather with failure in protein synthesis.  The
   possibility of hypoproteinemia secondary to liver dysfunction is
   attractive.  Although all liver function tests and biopsy findings
   were normal, this is often the case in patients with cystic
   fibrosis.  The anemia is associated with increased serum and marrow
   iron values, and is most likely due to a decrease in hemoglobin
   synthesis.  Routine cystic fibrosis therapy appears to be
   sufficient for clinical recovery for all components of the symptom
   complex.

AB A 3-day-old infant, meconium stained at birth, presented with
   respiratory distress.  Hypoplastic left heart syndrome was diagnosed
   clinically and documented at autopsy.  Unsuspected cystic fibrosis
   was demonstrated by the histologic presence of severe focal biliary
   cirrhosis with spreading fibrosis in the liver; minimal lesions in
   the pancreas and intestines were compatible with a diagnosis of
   cystic fibrosis.  The abundant hepatic fibrosis is unusual in an
   infant of this age indicating its in utero origin.  This case is
   also unusual because of the fortuitous association of cystic
   fibrosis and a congenital cardiac malformation.

AB Alterations in the pulmonary vascular bed were reviewed in the
   autopsy material from 35 patients with cystic fibrosis of the
   pancreas and cor pulmonale.  Hypertrophy of the media or intimal
   proliferation of small muscular arteries and arterioles was noted in
   eight patients; intimal proliferation of the larger caliber arteries
   was seen in seven patients.  The unexpected change, however, was the
   presence of interstitial hyaline material in the media of the
   pulmonary artery or its major branches in one-third of the
   specimens.  The elastic fibers were distorted, but not disrupted,
   and the finding was unrelated to the presence or severity of other
   vascular changes.  Intimal deposits of the same material were also
   present in seven of the patients with intimal proliferation in major
   pulmonary arteries.  Identical medial lesions were found in the
   pulmonary arteries of seven of 35 children with pulmonary
   hypertension and in seven patients with other disorders.  Similar
   lesions in the media of the aorta were found in each group of
   patients.  The material was not Schiff-reactive, but had the
   histochemical characteristics of a connective tissue acid
   mucopolysaccharide.

EX This letter is prompted by recent reports of favourable results
   after the use of an artificial diet consisting of a protein
   hydrolysate, a glucose polymer, and medium-chain glycerides in the
   treatment of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.  It has been our
   observation that children often find these preparations unpleasant
   and unpalatable.  Loose motions, nausea, and vomiting are quite
   common.  I have comparable experience with their use in other
   malabsorption states and advanced protein-calorie malnutrition.
   Whether the untoward effects result from excessive flooding of gut
   and/or exceedingly high blood-amino acid levels is a matter of
   speculation.

EX Dr. Conover and his colleagues reported no difference in the
   haemolytic activity of serum complement components C1-C9 of cystic
   fibrosis (C.F.) patients, obligate heterozygotes, and normal
   controls.  They also measured individual complement components by
   radial immunodiffusion and found a significant rise of C3 but no
   significant difference in C5 levels between these groups.  Using
   immunodiffusion kits from the same manufacturer and freshly
   obtained sera, we have observed quite different findings.  C5 was
   mildly elevated in 20 and more highly elevated in 25 of 56 C.F.
   patients, 2 to 29 years of age.  C5 was also elevated in 24 of 51
   parents of C.F. patients, 15 showing mild and 9 higher elevations,
   while 4 of 24 controls showed only mild elevation.  No correlation
   was observed between serum-C5 levels, and the age, sex, clinical
   severity of disease (judged by Shwachman-Kulczyki scores), sputum
   bacterial colonisation, and mode of treatment of the C.F. patients.
   The elevation of C3 and C5 in a majority of patients with C.F. and
   obligate heterozygotes is very interesting and is suggestive of
   certain genetic defect(s) in the complement activation system in
   this autosomal recessive disorder.

EX The letter from Professor Elliott appears to be the first record of
   skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis and may be an observation as
   important as that of di Sant' Agnese when he noted the high salt
   concentration of the sweat.  It seems that parents are well aware
   of this response, and repeating Professor Elliott's observation by
   soaking the hands of six infants with cystic fibrosis in hot water
   showed that very marked wrinkling was present by five minutes and
   often by two minutes.  This did not occur in control children of
   similar nutritional state except in a case of twins - one with
   cystic fibrosis, one without - where the unaffected child's fingers
   began to wrinkle slightly by five minutes.  The wrinkling does not
   appear to be associated with wasting due to malnutrition since it
   occurs equally in plump and in thin infants with cystic fibrosis,
   nor is it present in children with severe wasting and respiratory
   disease not due to cystic fibrosis.

   to be maintained by recurring mutation, this is not the case in
   Caucasians, where the carrier frequency is approximately 1 in 25.
   In order to establish a stable genetic polymorphism for a gene
   where the homozygous state is lethal, some degree of heterozygote
   advantage must exist, and it has been suggested that C.F.
   heterozygotes have a higher reproductive fitness than normal
   individuals.  It is not possible, of course, to know exactly how
   stable the C.F. polymorphism is, and one cannot exclude the
   possibility that some form of heterozygote advantage has existed at
   some time in the past and no longer exists today.  We should like
   to suggest a possible explanation which has much in common with the
   generally accepted explanation for the very high frequency of the
   sickle-cell gene in certain populations.  In the latter case,
   heterozygotes have an increased resistance to a particular type of
   malaria.  Patients with C.F. and heterozygous carriers have been
   found to have, in their serum, a substance (probably a protein)
   that agglutinates Proteus vulgaris.  Immunological cross-reactivity
   between certain strains of Proteus (e.g., OX 19) and Rickettsia
   prowazeki has long provided the basis of a serological test for
   typhus (Weil-Felix reaction).  Thus it is conceivable that the C.F.
   heterozygote might have an increased innate ability to counter
   infection by R. prowazeki.  Although typhus is known in many parts
   of the world, it seems to have been predominantly endemic and
   epidemic in the temperate regions inhabited by Caucasian peoples.
   Some areas where it is now endemic, such as South America, first
   experienced the disease after it had been introduced by Europeans.
   This would seem to be compatible with the observed higher C.F. gene
   frequency in Caucasians than in other groups.

EX Dr. Economou-Mavrou and his colleagues appear to have misunderstood
   my previous note concerning skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis.  The
   range of normality varies in different climatic conditions, and in
   Aukland wrinkling does not appear in cool tap-water (18-22 C) under
   3 minutes in normals.  Skin wrinkling on immersion appears to be
   age-related, but is difficult to detect reliably in the newborn.
   Prior washing of the hands, or immersion in sea-water (even the day
   before), accelerates skin wrinkling, as does warm weather.  I would
   suggest that "normality" needs redefining in Athens if 6 of 17
   "normals" were "abnormal".

EX In preliminary studies of short-term leukocyte cultures using
   Na2-35SO4 incorporation into cetyl-pyridinium-chloride
   (C.P.C.)-precipitable material (presumably glycosaminoglycans,
   G.A.G.), we have found significant variation among C.F. patients
   and their parents (obligate heterozygotes).  This biochemical
   heterogeneity is comparable to what has been reported in fibroblast
   cultures and serum.  The amount of Na2-35SO4 incorporated into
   G.A.G. material found in both the incubation medium and the cells
   from C.F. patients is significantly increased over normals.  A
   similar analysis between normals and heterozygotes shows no
   significant difference in Na2-35SO4 incorporation into G.A.G.
   material of the cells.  However, 4 out of 6 heterozygotes appeared
   to show a pattern of increased incorporation into material found in
   the incubation medium (indicated by a higher mean than the normal
   donors).  These results suggest yet another system to study the
   effects of the C.F. gene.  The incorporation of Na2-35SO4 into
   G.A.G. material of C.F. leukocyte cultures gives additional
   evidence for the genetic heterogeneity in this disorder.

EX Freshly obtained sera were assayed from 14 C.F. young adult
   patients (age 18 - 33, 7 men and 7 women) and from 15 control
   patients with bronchiectasis or chronic bronchitis in whom C.F. had
   been ruled out.  In addition, the blood from 2 mothers
   (heterozygotes) of C.F. patients was assayed.  The mean C3 level in
   the C.F. men was slightly lower than that in the male controls,
   whereas the C.F. women had a significantly higher mean level of C3
   than did the female controls.  The C3 level in the C.F. women was
   also significantly higher than that of the C.F. men (p < 0.01, t =
   3.855 by the Student's t test).  The female controls had slightly
   higher C3 levels than did the male controls, but this difference
   was not significant.  Comparison of C3 levels from all of the C.F.
   subjects to the controls shows considerable overlap in values,
   especially in the men.  These studies suggest that an assay of
   serum-C3 does not effectively distinguish C.F. subjects from
   patients with other types of chronic lung disease.  However, the
   differences between C.F. women and C.F. men is interesting and
   deserves further attention.  Our data from C.F. young adults do not
   fully confirm those reported by Conover et al., but it is possible
   that the experimental effects of carboxypeptidase B observed by
   Conover might result from action of the enzyme on the C.F. factor
   of serum, although its identity most likely is not C3a.

AB Previous studies on cystic fibrosis (C.F.) have shown increased
   mucopolysaccharide synthesis in C.F. cells.  The uptake of
   35S-heparin sulphonate into purified lymphocytes was examined after
   3 days' culture in medium 199 supplemented with 20% autochthonous 
   plasma.  Fourteen C.F. homozygotes, seven siblings, and nine parents
   all showed significantly greater uptake (p < 0.001) of 35S-heparin
   than cultures from twenty-three normal controls.  There was partial
   overlap in heparin-uptake values between C.F. patients and their
   families.  This procedure thus differentiates C.F. families from the
   normal population, but does not differentiate C.F. homozygotes from
   heterozygotes.  It is hoped that either variations in culture methods
   or a combination of this procedure with other measurements of C.F.,
   such as ciliary dyskinesis or cellular metachromasia, will permit
   unequivocal identification of C.F. carriers.

EX I have observed that the skin of children with cystic fibrosis
   wrinkles excessively early when soaked in tap water.  This physical
   sign is highly reliable irrespective of the degree of nutrition of
   the patient.  It is sometimes seen in infants with marasmus.
   Normal skin wrinkles eventually to exposure to water (except that
   from the Dead Sea).  It is possible that the disorder of salt flux
   in cystic fibrosis is connected with the apparent excessive
   hypertonic reactivity of the skin.  Three minutes and a bowl of
   water might provide a cheap screening test for this condition.

   children are in fact abnormally susceptible fo any respiratory
   pathogen from birth.  It is perhaps a bit premature to change the
   classical hypothesis for the bacteriology of C.F.  Since the
   predominant flora of hospital nurseries is not now Staph. aureus
   but rather gram-negative bacteria, it may be that the initial
   exposure of C.F. patients is to an organism other than Staph.
   aureus.  In addition, other organisms are becoming as resistant to
   antibodies as Ps. aeruginosa, so other organisms could perhaps be
   present in terminal sputum flora - which agrees with our data.

EX It has been claimed that the nitroblue tetrazolium (N.B.T.) test is
   of value in the surveillance of children with cystic fibrosis, a
   positive test giving evidence of active bacterial infection which
   may not be apparent clinically and not made evident by such
   investigations as the white-blood-cell count, sputum culture, and
   chest X-ray.  The test was therefore included in the routine
   assessment of patients attending this clinic.  Of the total 269
   N.B.T. tests, 110 were positive.  In only 57 of these cases was
   there other evidence of infection; these 57 were treated with
   antibiotics.  The remaining 53 were left untreated.  Of these, 41
   remained completely free of infection by standard criteria at
   subsequent review.  In 12 cases, however, the patient developed
   obvious infection before the next clinic visit.  It could be argued
   that in those cases the N.B.T. test had given early evidence of
   infection not otherwise apparent.  This is by no means certain,
   since the onset of infection could have been at any time during the
   four-week interval.  In our experience, the N.B.T. has been of
   little help in the management of cystic fibrosis.  There were in
   this series 27% false-negatives and at least 37% false-positives,
   some of which had very high counts.  It is possible, however, that
   in 12 (i.e., 4%) of the tests carried out, the N.B.T. gave early
   indication of infection not otherwise suspected.

   Sant'Agnese regarding their study on the reliability of the ciliary
   assays in cystic-fibrosis screening.  These investigators concluded
   that results from their study ruled out the possibility that
   reliable conclusions could be obtained from ciliary assays.  We
   feel that this conclusion is far from accurate, although it has
   never been the intention of any of our research groups to utilise
   ciliary preparations for massive heterozygote screening or prenatal
   diagnosis.  Ciliary assays have provided valuable scientific
   progress in cystic fibrosis research.  The existing assays are not
   suitable for massive screening for cystic fibrosis or for the
   clinical detection of cystic-fibrosis carriers; nevertheless, these
   techniques offer the most promising method to study, purify, and
   characterise a molecule or molecules directly or indirectly related
   to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.

   in patients with cystic fibrosis were also similar to the control

AB Large molecules which consistently stimulate hypersecretion in
   individual mucus-secretory sells in an animal system (the marine
   invertebrate Sipunculus) have been found in human serum and urine.
   This activity is heat-evoked in serum, heat-labile in urine.
   Heat-stable and heat-evoked factors were also found respectively in
   saliva and tears.  The serum and urine factors withstood
   freeze-thawing.  Activity of both factors was destroyed by pronase,
   and activity of the urine factor was destroyed by trypsin.  After
   incubation with alphaamylase the factor in urine induced production
   of a very aberrant type of secretion.

EX We were interested in Professor Elliott's description of early skin
   wrinkling in children with cystic fibrosis.  Although this
   phenomenon may well be related to osmotic differences between skin
   and water, it has been observed that skin wrinkling (as seen on the
   finger pulp) is fully dependent on an intact peripheral
   nerve-supply.  This is a useful sign in peripheral nerve lesions
   and helpful in following recovery when the wrinkling returns.
   Furthermore, it was our impression that in normal individuals
   wrinkling was more apparent on the left hand than on the
   right-handed individuals.  However, in a preliminary study using
   fingerprint densities measured by photometry, no significant
   differences were found between the sides.

EX Professor Elliott and Dr Norman and his colleagues suggested that
   excessive wrinkling of the skin after soaking in tap water might
   provide an easy, cheap, and probably reliable screening test for
   cystic fibrosis.  Our results show that this not true.  Marked
   wrinkling after immersion of the fingers in warm tap water for 5
   minutes was observed in randomly selected children with a wide
   variety of conditions, including not only cystic fibrosis but also
   malnutrition and renal, heart, endocrine, collagen, and other
   diseases.  It was elicited even in apparently healthy individuals,
   both young and adult.

AB The prevention of fetal malformations and abnormalities has long
   been the hope of obstetricians, paediatricians, and geneticists, but
   since the cause of most human malformations and of spontaneous gene
   and chromosome mutations is unknown, this must remain a dream for
   the present.  However, with the introduction of mid-trimester
   amniocentesis it is now possible to detect some abnormalities early
   enough for selective abortion of abnormal fetuses, though this
   should be considered a temporary expedient only.  The abnormalities
   which are amenable to this approach are the chromosome aberrations
   such as Down's syndrome, the neural-tube malformations including
   spina bifida cystica, and some recessively inherited and X-linked
   metabolic disorders.

EX We have reported that red-cell glutathione reductase (G.R.)
   activity is increased in cystic-fibrosis (C.F.) patients in
   comparison with age and sex matched controls.  We have also
   demonstrated that serum-G.R. activity is significantly greater in
   C.F. than in controls, obligate heterozygotes, and patients with a
   variety of respiratory and immunological diseases.  Moreover,
   serum-G.R. from C.F. patients and carriers responds differently
   from controls after storage or incubation with heparin.  We have
   now examined G.R. in white blood-cells (W.B.C.) of C.F. patients.
   The day after collection of samples mean W.B.C.-G.R. activity was
   significantly less in the C.F. group than in carriers and controls.
   No differences in G.R. activity between the groups was apparent
   after 4 and 6 days.  White-cell G.R. activity apparently is lower
   in C.F. patients than in controls.  We cannot rationalise this
   decrease with the increased activity found in C.F. red cells and
   serum.  Nevertheless, the differences between C.F. and controls are
   of greater interest than the apparent directional contradiction.
   The basis for quantatitive enzyme differences is very difficult to
   determine.  The simplest explanation is that the initial white-cell
   G.R. differences between C.F. patients on the one hand and controls
   and carriers on the other are secondary to some aspect of the

EX The water-binding capacity of a protein is minimal at its
   isoelectric point (pH 3.5 - 5 for the keratins making up the horny
   layers) and increases with increasing divergence from the
   isoelectric point.  It is for this reason that normal palmar skin
   wrinkles after moderate immersion in warm water, especially if it
   is soapy (pH 8 or more).  However, in patients with cystic fibrosis
   it is the increased salt content of the sweat rather than the pH
   difference which increases the water-binding capacity of the
   keratin, and is responsible for the wrinkling in these patients.

EX At present it is extremely doubtful if mass-population screening for
   any inherited metabolic disease other than phenylketonuria should be
   established beyond the few pilot studies at present in progress.  For
   many diseases, although early detection is clearly desirable or the
   technical means of screening are available, even the establishment of
   pilot surveys is not yet indicated.  Instead, methods of screening
   more limited populations at risk for particular disorders within a
   nationally coordinated administrative structure should be
   established.  Those with experience of mass screening for more than
   one inherited metabolic disease must surely be convinced that in new
   programmes launched prematurely the harm caused by incomplete
   detection of cases or recognition of disorders whose management is
   uncertain or unavailable can far outweigh any benefits.

EX In 1969 Danes and Bearn proposed that the metachromasia noted in
   short-term white-blood-cell cultures from both cystic fibrosis
   (C.F.) homozygotes and heterozygotes probably reflected uptake of
   heparin from the culture-medium by pinocytosis and not, as in the
   genetic mucopolysaccharidoses, stored mucopolysaccharides.  This
   hypothesis was recently confirmed by Robertson et al.  Using
   35S-heparin they demonstrated an increased uptake of heparin in
   short-term C.F. white-blood-cell cultures which corresponded to the
   observations made on the basis of staining.  However, as mentioned
   in 1971 by Bafalluy et al., any white blood-cell in culture can be
   overloaded with heparin.  As the processes involved in endocytosis
   and exocytosis probably are inconstant within one cell and
   certainly in different cell types, standardisation of cytoplasmic
   retention of heparin may not be possible in order to eliminate the
   partial overlap between normals, C.F. homozygotes and obligatory
   heterozygotes observed by Robertson et al.  This report on
   35S-heparin again raised the question of the significance of
   cellular mucopolysaccharides in cystic fibrosis.  The relevance of
   mucopolysaccharides in the C.F. cultured cell is still unclear.
   Between 1968 and 1970 the mucopolysaccharide content of the
   cultured fibroblast was reported as normal and variable.

AB Presumptive evidence indicates that the substance responsible for
   the pathophysiologic conditions of cystic fibrosis (CF) is a
   complement component, C3a, also known as anaphylatoxin.  The known
   biochemical and physiological properties of C3a, together with the
   behavior of this purified substance when associated with IgG in our
   tracheal bioassay, compare favorably with those of molecular species
   which  we have separated from sera and cell cultures of CF
   homozygotes and heterozygotes.  Sera from normal healthy subjects,
   previously inactive by bioassay for ciliary dyskinesia factor (CDF),
   were converted to a CDF positive state by incubation with
   epsilon-amino-caproic-acid (EACA).  EACA is a known inhibitor of the
   carboxypeptidase-B-like anaphylatoxin inactivator, and is the method
   of choice for accumulating anaphylatoxins in normal blood.
   Incubation of EACA-treated normal sera and two fresh CDF-positive CF
   sera with carboxypeptidase-B produced reversion in all instances to
   a CDF negative, normal state.  It is proposed that anaphylatoxin
   inactivator, a carboxypeptidase-B-like enzyme, is defective or
   deficientin cystic fibrosis and that this deficiency is the primary
   gene defect.

AB Ascorbic acid, acting on its own, is found to exert a bacteriostatic
   action in vitro on 16 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa tested.
   This action, attributable to the oxidation of ascorbic acid, is
   dependent on individual strains and the inoculum size.  In
   combination with sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim, Septrin,
   ampicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol or colistin sulphate,
   ascorbic acid acts synergistically on Pseudomonas aeruginosa in
   vitro.  Experiments in mice with erythromycin-ascorbic acid
   combination show that the curvative dose 50 of ascorbic acid acting
   alone is 11.22 milligrammes per kilogram body weight.  This was
   significantly lowered (P =< 0.001) to 6.91 mg/kg if administered in
   combination with erythromycin (10 mg/kg).  In human patients with
   cystic fibrosis, by the combined administration of ascorbic acid
   sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim, Roche) the pseudomonas
   infection could be controlled, as the viable number of organisms
   significantly diminished during the therapy.

EX One of the characteristics of cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal
   recessive disease, is a defect in the net sodium transport in the
   eccrine glands resulting in an increased concentration of sodium in
   the sweat.  Because of possible complications in the erythrocytes
   from CF patients, and since the activity observed in a cell
   homogenate may not express the situation in the intact cell, we have
   looked for differences in the binding of 3H-ouabain in cultured
   normal and CF human diploid fibroblasts.  We observed no appreciable
   differences in the number of ouabain-binding sites between normal
   and CF cell strains.  We were also unable to observe any differences
   in the kinetics of ouabain-binding between normal and CF fibroblasts
   in K+-free phosphate-buffered saline solution, and the results were
   essentially the same as those seen in HeLa cells.  We observed no
   alterations in the kinetics of binding of ouabain nor any alteration
   in the total number of binding sites.

EX Using the technique of 3H-ouabain binding to isolate cells Quissell
   and Pitot concluded that the Na+-K+ ATPase functions normally in
   fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis patients.  However this finding
   may not be very relevant to the Na+ transport defect occurring in
   this genetic disease.  The Na+ transport abnormality in cystic
   fibrosis seems to be confined to exocrine glands.  It is unknown at
   present whether the defect resides in an active or passive
   transport step of the cation.  At least with isolated sweat gland
   tissue and erythrocytes from cystic fibrosis patients, Na+-K+
   ATPase activity has been found to be normal.  However a decrease in
   the ethacrynic acid-sensitive efflux, a Na+ exchange mechanism, has
   been reported in cystic fibrosis erythrocytes.  These findings
   suggest that there is no fundamental abnormality in the Na+-K+
   ATPase enzyme in the disease, but there may be a defect in an
   ethacrynic acid-sensitive transport step.  Therefore in order to
   obtain a better understanding of the cation transport defect one
   should measure the binding of labelled ethacrynic-acid rather than
   ouabain.

EX The nature of the metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) has, to
   date, not been elucidated.  Elliott reported that intravenous
   administration of soybean oil and lecithin to children suffering
   from CF caused their sweat sodium concentration to decrease towards
   normal values.  This prompted us to investigate the fatty acid
   spectra of the various serum lipid classes of children with CF.  We
   have found that affected children are deficient in essential fatty
   acids.  The data suggest another approach to the study of the
   metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis.  There is an apparent
   deficiency in essential fatty acids, and a marked reduction in
   serum vitamin E levels has also been reported in CF.  These
   conditions might be partially corrected by intravenous injection,
   or possibly feeding of, lipids containing essential fatty acids
   with concomitant administration of vitamin E.  The observed
   deficiency in essential fatty acids may be produced by a reduced
   ability to absorb these acids from the diet and this, in turn, may
   result in defects in membrane structure or stability.  Reduced
   levels of vitamin E in CF may reflect a reduced requirement for
   this vitamin because of the lower levels of essential fatty acids.
   It is also possible that the observed deficiency in serum levels of
   essential fatty acids may lead to less than normal production of
   prostaglandins.

AB A tool to assess psychosocial adjustment of school-age children with
   cystic fibrosis was developed using three instruments: a
   standardized open-ended parent interview, a self-administered
   teacher questionnaire, and a self-administered parent demographic
   data form.  The three instruments enabled the pediatric nurse
   practitioner to make a clinical assessment of the child's
   psychosocial adjustment.  This assessment was then checked for
   validity by means of a social worker interview.  Implications for
   further research are discussed.

MN CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: nu.  HOME-NURSING.
EX Nearly all agree that home therapy, which permits cystic fibrosis
   children to lead nearly normal lives, is desirable.  Between hospital
   visits, it's also essential for warding off the primary threats of
   CF: pulmonary insufficiency and cor pulmonale.  Treatment is
   palliative, focusing on supplying enzymes that the body can't secrete
   and, when the lungs are involved, clearing airway obstructions.  The
   first step in therapy is starting the child on supplemental enzymes,
   which will enable him to absorb fat and protein.  Usually we
   encourage a normal diet.  If X-rays, pulmonary function tests, or
   clinical observation shows lung involvement, we initiate pulmonary
   therapy and teach parents how to perform it at home.  Postural
   drainage is continued indefinitely, even if the lungs clear.  If the
   child shows clinical signs of infection, we instruct the parents to
   increase the number of active mist and postural drainage treatments
   and to administer oral antibiotics in high doses.  Above all, we
   instruct the parents of CF children to treat them as normally as
   possible.

EX Cystic fibrosis is an inborn disease which affects chiefly the lungs
   and the digestive system.  Today cystic fibrosis is known to be one
   of the commonest genetic disorders affecting children in Britain.
   The children who actually develop cystic fibrosis have inherited the
   disease from both parents, who are carriers but are unaffected by the
   disease themselves.  Being thick and sticky, instead of thin and
   slimy as it normally is, the mucus of the cystic fibrosis case tends
   to block the passages instead of clearing them.  The main problem is
   in the lungs.  Symptoms, diagnosis, care of nutrition, prevention of
   infection, respiratory education, and future research are discussed.

EX Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are fats in which the chain length
   is six to twelve carbon atoms.  This is in contrast to the more usual
   dietary sources of fats, long-chain triglycerides (LCT), which
   contain more than 14 carbon atoms in their atomic chain.  The
   differences in chemical structure between LCT and MCT are important
   because they are related to major differences in the characteristics
   of absorption and metabolism of these two classes of lipids.  These
   physiological differences between LCT and MCT have led to the use of
   MCT in various disorders where malabsorption of LCT occurs but where
   MCT can be absorbed because they bypass several of the steps
   necessary for the absorption of long chain fats.  These include
   pancreatic disease, chronic liver disease, disorders of the biliary
   tract and diseases of the small intestinal epithelium and lymphatic
   vessels.  The comments which follow are a brief summary of the
   therapeutic place of MCT in children with malabsorption.  This will
   be followed by some remarks about the potential value of MCT in
   countries like Indonesia where the commonest cause of chronic
   diarrhoea and malabsorption in children is malnutrition and chronic
   and repeated gastrointestinal infections and infestations and where
   MCT has not been used widely.

AB Diarrhea can be defined as excess loss of water and electrolytes in
   feces, but what is an excess?  To the physician, fecal losses may be
   excessive when they cause the patient to be ill; to a parent a stool
   pattern that differs from that of a neighbor's infant or even a
   single watery stool may be too much.  New knowledge of normal gut
   function and the pathologic processes that may afflict the child's
   alimentary tract has improved one capability to diagnose and manage
   certain specific diseases that cause diarrhea.  Although of great
   interest to academicians, many of these diseases are extraordinarily
   rare and in most practices there is a substantial and perplexing
   pool of poopers in whom no specific disease can be found.
   Fortunately, patients in this latter group are rarely seriously ill.
   This article attempts to help the practitioner understand, diagnose
   and treat children with specific diseases known to cause chronic
   diarrhea.  We will speculate also on the mechanisms and management
   of idiopathic chronic diarrhea.

EX Cystic fibrosis is an intricate, vexatious disease involving the
   whole patient.  As yet we are only able to treat the signs and
   symptoms, and this should be done as completely as possible.
   Treatment is geared at eradicating the Staphylococcus aureus from the
   lung and preventing reinfection.  Gram-negative organisms,
   particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are treated when they become
   pathogenic.  Other conditions such as atopia of the respiratory tract
   or gastrointestinal system may be detrimental to the patient's cystic
   fibrosis condition and must be controlled.  Pancreatic insufficiency
   requires adequate enzyme replacement therapy to prevent steatorrhea
   and azotorrhea.  If fatty acids play a role in membrane oxygen
   transport then their abnormal composition in cystic fibrosis may
   require specific changes in the type of fat intake.  Salt depletion
   should be looked for and corrected.  A screening test for cystic
   fibrosis is needed, preferably one done on a small blood specimen.

EX Chronic illness at any age is unfortunate.  It taxes the strengths
   and resources of the individual and those associated with him.  The
   chronically ill teenager faces difficulties different from those of
   the child or adult.  Illness itself is a burden to the adolescent;
   chronic illness is an even greater burden.  The tasks of maturation
   which must be successfully completed in adolescence are made more
   difficult by chronic ill health.  Impact upon the patient,
   educational needs, sexuality needs, life expectancy, impact upon the
   family, and impact upon society are examined.  Specific illnesses,
   such as diabetes mellitus and fibrocystic disease, are discussed.

AB The retrograde perfusion assay of Magos for the sodium reabsorption
   inhibitory effect in sweat and mixed saliva from patients with
   cystic fibrosis (CF) was modified by (1) using the second parotid
   gland of the rat as a control, (2) carefully controlling the
   quantity of saliva perfused into the rat parotid gland so that the
   ratio of milliliters perfused to gram dry gland weight fell between
   1.8 and 2.8, and (3) reporting the inhibitory effect as percentage
   of inhibition of the rate of sodium reabsorption (RNa) in the
   perfused gland calculated from the difference between the RNa's in
   the two glands.  Using this modified assay we were able to confirm
   that significant differences exist in the percentage of inhibition
   of RNa caused by CF and normal mixed saliva (47.0 plus or minus 24.8
   and 18.0 plus or minus 8.3, mean plus or minus SD).  In addition,
   similar significant differences in the percentage of inhibition of
   RNa by submandibular gland secretions (39.7 plus or minus 13.5 and
   16.0 plus or minus 11.8), sublingual gland secretions (39.5 plus or
   minus 6.0 and 19.7 plus or minus 14.3), and submucosal gland
   secretions (34.0 plus or minus 11.7 and 21.7 plus or minus 12.7)
   between CF and normal subjects were observed.  However, parotid
   gland secretions from CF subjects showed no increased inhibitory
   effect (12.5 plus or minus 7.9 and 12.5 plus or minus 6.6).  These
   findings demonstrate that the sodium reabsorption inhibitory effect
   is produced by the secretions from some but not all salivary glands
   of patients with CF.

AB No differences were found in the methylation of total nucleic acids,
   total RNA, DNA, tRNA, or rRNA from lymphocytes or fibroblasts
   obtained from normal subjects, obligate heterozygotes, or
   individuals with cystic fibrosis.  Similar results were obtained
   using four methods for isolation of the nucleic acids.  The reasons
   for the failure of two laboratories to discern the reported
   variations in methylation of RNA in the normal, carrier, or cystic
   fibrosis state may be obscure differences in culture conditions or
   conditions of extraction.

AB A calcium-precipitable protein (CaPP), previously shown to cause
   turbidity of submaxilliary saliva (SMS) in patients with cystic
   fibrosis (CF), was purified from normal and CF-SMS by (NH4)2SO4
   precipitation, gel filtration, and preparative polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis.  This protein has a molecular weight of 12,000.  It
   contains large numbers of serine, glycine, and glutamic acid
   residues, 0.85% phosphorus as phosphate monoester, and small amounts
   of carbohydrate.  Precipitation (aggregation) of CaPP occurs at basic
   pH values in the presence of ionic calcium and is enhanced by
   increasing calcium concentration, CaPP concentration, or pH.
   Aggregated CaPP binds calcium in molar quantities equal to the
   number of phosphate prosthetic groups.  Alkaline phosphatase removes
   all phosphate from CaPP and eliminates calcium-induced
   precipitation.  Studies of CaPP from CF saliva have demonstrated no
   electrophoretic or compositional differences from normal CaPP.
   Higher than normal pH values or elevated CaPP concentrations are not
   present in SMS of patients with CF and do not contribute to the
   formation of turbid SMS.  Aggregation and precipitation of CaPP in
   saliva of patients with CF seems to be induced primarily by elevated
   levels of calcium in saliva.  This precipitation may be entirely, or
   in part, responsible for focal obstruction of submaxillary gland
   ducts in patients with CF.  However, little or no CaPP is secreted
   in the lower gastrointestinal or tracheobronchial tracts.
   Therefore, CaPP does not play a more general role in the obstructive
   processes which characterize CF.

AB ATPase activity and monovalent cation transport were examined in
   erythrocytes (RBC) of subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF).  The RBC
   membrane (Ca2+)ATPase activity of homozygous patients and obligate
   heterozygotes was indistinguishable from that of normal control
   subjects.  This was true similarly for total, ouabain-sensitive,
   and ouabain-insensitive (Na+-K+)ATPase.  Total, ouabain-sensitive,
   and ouabain-insensitive 24Na+ transport were normal in CF cells.
   Ouabain-induced Na+ accumulation was similar in CF and normal RBC.
   Measurements of K+ transport in CF RBC were, likewise, normal.  We
   conclude that intrinsic ATPase and monovalent transport functions
   are normal in CF RBC.  We were unable to confirm several
   abnormalities in these cells reported previously.  The CF RBC is not
   helpful in defining a transport abnormality in that entity.  These
   studies document normal intrinsic transport function in RBC of
   patients with CF.  There have been reports of an abnormal serum
   factor in patients with CF.  This factor might be involved in the
   production of a transport defect in CF.  Further studies are
   indicated to determine whether CF plasma contains a factor capable
   of altering membrane transport functions of normal RBC.

AB Arginine esterase activity in chloroform-ellagic acid-treated plasma
   from 11 patients with cystic fibrosis(CF) and 12 age-matched control
   subjects has been resolved into its component fractions by ion
   exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and electrofocusing on
   polyacrylamide gels.  The activity can be resolved into two
   fractions by chromatography, one of which is inhibited by soybean
   trypsin inhibitor (STI) and the other of which is not inhibited by
   STI.  In plasma of CF patients, the fraction of activity inhibited
   by STI is reduced to approximately 30% of the corresponding fraction
   in control plasma.  In contrast, the fraction of activity resistant
   to inhibition by STI did not show any significant quantitative
   differences between control and CF plasma samples.  Analysis of
   plasma samples by electrofocusing on 5% polyacrylamide gels in the
   range of pH 5.0-8.0 and subsequent staining for arginine esterase
   activity showed qualitative differences between control and CF
   plasma samples.  Six activity bands could be detected in control
   samples, whereas five bands were detected in CF samples.  Eight
   samples had one type of band missing, two had another type of band
   missing, and one had yet another type of band missing.  All of these
   bands were restricted to a narrow pH zone in the center of the gel.
   These data are consistent with and extend our earlier reports of
   differences in arginine esterase activity between plasma samples of
   CF patients and control subjects.  The demonstration of the absence
   of a single band of arginine esterase activity is consistent with
   the absence of a specific arginine esterase isoenzyme in patients
   with CF.  The deficiency of arginine esterase in patients with
   cystic fibrosis may account for the presence of "factors" in saliva,
   plasma, and fibroblasts of these patients and consequently for the
   clinical manifestations of the disease.

EX The fact that amniotic cells from fetuses at high risk for the CF
   gene, as well as cells derived from heterozygous individuals,
   produce the ciliary inhibitor suggests a close relation to the
   genetic defect and necessitates further identification and
   characterization of the responsible molecule.

AB A comprehensive study of tRNA and 18 S and 28 S rRNA methylation in
   human fibroblasts is presented.  Cells from normal volunteers and
   patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were examined during exponential
   growth by incubation with L-(methyl-14C)methionine and (3H)uridine.
   The ratio of 14C to 3H counts per minute in isolated RNA serves as a
   measure of the extent of methylation and was found to be similar in
   normal and CF fibroblasts for tRNA, 18 S rRNA, and 28 S rRNA.
   Hydrolyzed samples of (14C)-methyl-labeled RNA species were analyzed
   by two dimensional chromatography and autoradiography.  The
   methylated base and nucleoside compositions of tRNA and rRNA agree
   well with data for HeLa cells and other eurkaryote cells such as
   those from yeast, mouse, and chicken.  RNA methylation patterns in
   CF fibroblasts were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to
   those observed in normal cells for 4 S, 18 S, and 28 S RNA.  There
   is no evidence that RNA species from patients with cystic fibrosis
   are deficient in any methylated components.  Methylation of RNA by
   tissue-cultured cells from cystic fibrosis is qualitatively and
   quantitatively normal and will not prove to be a useful marker for
   identification of carriers of cystic fibrosis.

AB To assess small airway disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with
   minimal pulmonary involvement, maximal expiratory flow volume (MEFV)
   curves were obtained while the patients were breathing first air and
   then an 80% helium-20% oxygen gas mixture.  Fifteen CF patients and
   24 controls were studied.  Flow rates at 50% and 25% vital capacity
   (VC) were calculated from the air and helium-mixture MEFV curves and
   were compared to give flow ratios at these lung volumes.  At 50% VC,
   the helium/air flow ratios were similar in CF patients and normal
   subjects.  At 25% VC, the flow ratio was significantly lower (p < 
   0.05) in the CF patients.  The air and helium MEFV curves were
   superimposed and the point where the curves crossed (point of
   identical flow, PIF) was determined and expressed in % VC.  For the
   CF patients, the mean PIF was 18% and for the controls, 5% (p <
   .001).  Nine of the 15 CF patients had PIF values greater than 2
   standard deviations (SD) from the normal mean.  None of the
   following tests were abnormal in more than three patients: FEV1/FVC,
   MMEF, RV/TLC, Vmax 50% TLC (TLC/sec), and Vmax 25% VC (TLC/sec).
   Arterial oxygen tensions were below 86 mm Hg in four patients.
   Closing volumes by the 100% helium bolus technique were normal in
   all patients.  Determination of the PIF appears to be a simple,
   noninvasive, and sensitive test for the detection of early small
   airway involvement.

AB Intellectual performance, sensory motor abilities and social
   adaptation were studied in 41 subjects (2 to 21 years of age) who
   had severe malnutrition in infancy.  A control group consisted of
   41 siblings.  The mean IQ of 31 parents ws 108 (S.D. plus or minus
   11.3).  Socioeconomic deprivation was not present.  The results of
   the Merrill-Palmer test for the malnourished group and the controls
   revealed significant differences in favor of the controls.  No
   differences were found in the older population for whom the WISC and
   WAIS were used.  The Lincoln-Oseretsky test of motor development and
   the Vineland scale of social maturity showed no significant
   differences.  These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
   malnutrition in infancy can affect intellectual development in the
   first five years of life.  Beyond this age, given adequate
   socioeconomic support, no significant differences were observed.

EX The management of cystic fibrosis continues to present a constant
   therapeutic problem to both pediatrician and internist.  In these
   hospitalized patients, the use of a butterfly scalp vein needle
   attached to a plastic tubing sealed by a rubber cap ("Heparin Lock")
   offers many advantages.  This report relates our experience with
   this method.  The use of an indwelling intravenous infusion set for
   the home administration of potent antibiotics has been quite
   successful in the therapy of the chronic bronchopulmonary infection
   associated with cystic fibrosis.

TI Letter: Rates and calcium concentrations of sweat in relation to
   cystic fibrosis.
SO Pediatrics. 1974 Apr. 53(4). P 584-5.
MJ CALCIUM: an.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: me.  SWEAT: an.

EX The authors of the recent article which failed to show a
   significant difference between sweat calcium concentrations of CF
   patients and control subjects, suggest that the findings refute our
   hyperpermeability hypothesis.  They found sweat Ca of 0.32 to 1.67
   mEq/liter in 26 control subjects and 0.42 to 2.03 mEq/liter in 16
   CF patients.  With these tremendous ranges many more subjects would
   be required to prove or disprove a difference.  A difference
   undetectable in a moderate number of subjects is probably not of
   pathophysiologic significance if the Ca really varies
   unpredictably.  Sweat Ca, however, is generally believed to vary
   with the rate of sweating, being much higher at lower rates, and
   measurements made at comparable rates might well show significant
   differences.  The authors did attempt to control rate, but in a
   very inappropriate manner.  They measured no constant rate, but
   took the average rate during the 30 minutes immediately after
   iontophoresis.  This gives little information concerning the rate
   at which the sweat was actually produced.

AB The diagnosis, management and prognosis of 17 infants with cystic
   fibrosis  (CF) and severe respiratory disease were reviewed for the
   period 1968 to 1972.  The clinical course of these infants was
   characterized by a bronchiolitis-like syndrome with failure to
   thrive and malnutrition.  Arterial blood gases demonstrated marked
   hypoxemia (mean PaO2, 36.5 mm Hg).  Tracheal cultures showed a
   predominance of gram-negative microorganisms with Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli
   predominating.  Corticosteroids were used in all patients.  Despite
   vigorous therapy including antibiotics there was a 60% mortality.
   A delay in the diagnosis of CF from the onset if respiratory
   symptoms with a mean of six weeks was considered an important factor
   affecting survival.  This data supports the need for developing a
   reliable screen test for CF at birth.

AB Liver-spleen scans on 254 children were reviewed retrospectively
   with regard to accuracy and yield of examination.  The scan
   predicted abnormality correctly 95% of the time and normality
   correctly 86% of the time.  Pitfalls in interpretation include the
   nonspecificity of abnormalities present on the scan, confusion of
   extrinsic with intrinsic defects, and normal anatomical variations
   with pathology.  The technetium-99m-sulfur colloid scan was found to
   be most helpful in diagnosing splenic abnormalities, in working up
   abdominal masses, and in evaluating tumor patients with a baseline
   scan.  It was found least useful in patients with fever of unknown
   origin, abdominal pain, diffuse liver disease, and most inflammatory
   conditions.  Liver abscesses were not found in febrile, otherwise
   healthy children.  The iodine-131-rose bengal liver scan was found
   to be useful to differentiate potentially curable lesions (e.g.,
   choledochal cysts) from those not surgically treatable.

AB Amylase isoenzyme patterns were evaluated in serum, urine, and
   duodenal fluid from 19 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and normal
   subjects.  Two thirds of the CF patients with absent pancreatic
   enzymes lacked a serum pancreatic isoamylase band, while the
   remainder had a markedly diminished pancreatic band when compared to
   the salivary isoamylase.  In normal sera the pancreatic band is
   equal to or greater than the salivary band.  In all patients with
   absent enzymes the diagnosis of abnormal pancreatic function could
   have been made by evaluation of serum isoamylase patterns thereby
   avoiding duodenal intubation or collection of 72-hour stools for
   proteolytic enzyme activities.  The patients with normal pancreatic
   enzyme activities had normal serum zymograms.  No CF patient had a
   low total serum amylase concentration.  Total duodenal fluid amylase
   levels may be misleading in the evaluation of pancreatic function
   since the amylase may be of salivary origin.  The advantages of this
   isoamylase method include (1) simplicity and noninvasiveness,
   requiring only a small blood sample; (2) specificity for pancreatic
   function; and (3) independence of pancreatic enzyme medication.

AB Gastric mucosal biopsies from eight new untreated patients with
   cystic fibrosis (CF) and two normal subjects were studied by
   quantitative techniques of electron microscopy (EM) to determine
   whether presecreted gastric mucus was more compact (viscid) than
   normal.  Analysis of variance techniques show no differences between
   means of all groups studied.  These observations suggest that mucus
   may not be viscid prior to secretion.  Electron microscopy of
   gastric mucus does not appear to be of diagnostic value in CF.

AB Gentamicin is a broad-spectrum, bactericidal aminoglycoside
   antibiotic in its tenth year of use in the U.K.  League tables of
   antibiotics, ranked by disc sensitivity tests against urinary tract
   pathogens and Staph. aureus confirm its remarkable effectiveness in
   1973.  Bacteriodes sp. and some streptococci are the only major
   omissions from its spectrum.  MIC of sensitive strains is usually
   less than or equal to 2 microg/ml although Pseudomonas may require
   greater than or equal to 4 microg/ml.  The therapeutic range aimed
   for is 2-12 microg/ml in serum and peak levels are measured 1 hr
   after intramuscular and 20 min after intravenous injection.  Most
   workers regard a level of 12 microg/ml as potentially toxic and try
   to avoid exceeding it.

EX The aim of a therapeutic diet is to provide a nutritionally adequate
   diet from a variety of natural and/or specially prepared artificial
   food substitutes for the treatment of specific clinical disorders.
   The role of the dietitian is to work as a member of the medical team.
   Paediatric dietetics require rather more detailed advice and help for
   the parents, particularly when the diet involves calculation or
   restriction of specific nutrients.  Dietary considerations in
   obesity, diabetes mellitus, coeliac disease, cystic fibrosis,
   carbohydrate intolerance, galactosaemia, and phenylketonuria are
   discussed.

EX This paper analyzes the cell cycle of cystic fibrosis-derived
   fibroblasts and statistically demonstrates their failure to support a
   normal population doubling time in vitro and indicates that this is
   due largely to a failure of the cystic fibrosis-derived cells to
   enter the cell cycle in normal numbers.  We have no explanation for
   the significant difference in the behavior of these cells from
   patients with cystic fibrosis vis-a-vis either normal or disease
   control fibroblasts, save to conclude that it proceeds from an
   intrinsic property of the cells themselves.

AB Twenty-five children aged 8 months to 17 years were studied to
   determine the usefulness of computer-assisted ventilation-perfusion
   (V-P) scanning in analysis of regional pulmonary function in cystic
   fibrosis.  Ventilation and perfusion scintiphotographs were compared
   with the patients' radiographs.  Regional fractional exchanges of
   air and relative regional V-P ratios were obtained.  Whole-lung
   air-exchange was significantly correlated with standard pulmonary
   function tests and radiograph scores.  Ventilation-perfusion ratio
   gradients were reversed in pats with predominantly upper zone
   disease, and regional V-P ratios were uneven in distribution.
   Quantitative assessment of regional ventilation and perfusion is a
   useful technique for assessing severity of pulmonary disease in
   children with cystic fibrosis.

AB The endoscopic pancreaticographic findings in 46 proved cases of
   pancreatitis are analyzed.  Pathologic ductograms were demonstrated
   in approximately 60%.  Significant information was obtained in many
   cases, allowing both proper diagnosis of the primary disease process
   and complications thereof.  Because of the latter, the procedure has
   proved to be quite helpful in isolating those patients who could
   benefit from surgery.

AB Albumin in meconium was quantitated by means of a single radial
   immunodiffusion technique, which is described in detail.  The method
   shows good precision and accuracy for this material, when certain
   conditions associated with collection, preparation, and analysis are
   observed.  The method can discriminate between healthy newborns and
   newborns with cystic fibrosis.

AB Tobramycin treatment of chronic pulmonary infections caused by
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 13 children with cystic fibrosis was
   evaluated.  Initially the patients received the recommended dose
   of 125 mg/m2/24 hours; the dose was then increased to 250 mg/m2/24
   hours (approximately 10 mg/kg/24 hours).  This higher dosage was
   administered intramuscularly to 9 patients.  Eight of these
   received additional therapy with an aerosol containing tobramycin.
   With this therapy it was possible to eradicate Ps. aeruginosa from
   the respiratory tract in 5 of the patients.  After discontinuing
   therapy Ps. aeruginosa re-occurred in all patients within one month.
   All patients showed a clinical improvement in relation to therapy.
   No toxic or allergic side effects were observed.

AB Thirty-five patients with cystic fibrosis (aged 11 months to 13.5
   years) have been investigated with regard to respiratory symptoms,
   respiratory tract pathogens, serum immunoglobulins and serum
   precipitins.  Haemophilus influenzae was the commonest pathogen
   being supplanted in advanced disease by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  The
   patients who had no respiratory infection had levels of IgG
   significantly lower than normal children of comparable ages.  In
   children with severe respiratory infection the immunoglobulins
   were raised and precipitins to the predominant respiratory organism
   were present.  These findings differ from the prevalent view that
   patients with cystic fibrosis have a normal response to infection
   and that the common infecting organism is Staphylococcus aureus.

AB To compare the in vitro susceptibility of mucoid and nonmucoid
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa to gentamicin, 144 isolates of both mucoid
   and nonmucoid P aeruginosa were cultured from throat swab and
   sputum specimens from 29 patients with diagnosed cystic fibrosis.
   Mucoid forms of P aeruginosa from throat swab cultures were all
   susceptible to gentamicin, whereas only 85.5% of the mucoid strains
   from sputum cultures were susceptible.  Nonmucoid strains from
   throat swab and sputum cultures were 85.1% and 77.8% susceptible,
   respectively.  Since the differences in susceptibility between the
   four groups of organisms were not significant (P < 0.05), it was
   concluded that these data show no real differences in susceptibility
   to gentamicin between the mucoid and nonmucoid strains.

EX The purpose of the present work was to study the type of inheritance
   involved in mucoviscidosis.  Analysis of the genetic relations in
   mucoviscidosis performed on 26 families bears witness to a monomeric
   autosomal mechanism of transmission of the character.  In contrast to
   other recessive diseases, parental consanguinity plays a secondary
   role in mucoviscidosis, which apparently is explained by the wide
   distribution of the mucoviscidosis gene among the population.  The
   observations described may be utilized in medicogenetic consultations
   given to members of those families where there are children suffering
   from mucoviscidosis.

EX It has been suggested that the development of goiter and
   hypothyroidism in patients receiving chronic iodide therapy indicates
   that they have underlying thyroid disease.  In 1971, Dolan and
   Gibson, in a retrospective study, reviewed the records of children
   with cystic fibrosis receiving chronic expectorant therapy with
   iodide and reported that approximately 85 percent had goiter and 15
   percent suggestive clinical findings of hypothyroidism.  This study,
   together with the fact that the thyroid, like lung and pancreas, is
   of endodermal origin raised the possibility that patients with cystic
   fibrosis might have an underlying defect in thyroid function.  As
   thyroid function in patients with cystic fibrosis has not been
   evaluated in a systematic fashion, the present study was undertaken.
   In it, we have evaluated basal thyroid function in a large group of
   patients with cystic fibrosis and have, in addition, observed the
   effects of chronic iodide administration.  The present study strongly
   suggests that there often occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis
   some derangement in thyroid hormone economy.  The frequency with
   which iodides increased serum thyrotropin, decreased serum thyroxine
   concentration, and induced goiter, with or without hypothyroidism, in
   patients with cystic fibrosis, points strongly to the presence of an
   intrinsic abnormality of the thyroid in this disease.  The nature of
   such abnormality remains unclear.

   and to evoke an antibody response in groups of patients who have a

   Three groups of patients were studied: 35 burn patients; seven small
   children with cystic fibrosis; and 35 patients who were about to
   undergo coronary vein grafts.  The results of vaccination were

EX The author has attempted to evaluate some of the methodology
   currently in use or suggested for the routine determination of
   vitamin A in blood and tissues.  Special consideration is given to
   extraneous factors which can cause erroneous results in fluorometric
   analyses.  A review of the older and current literature on the
   distribution of vitamin A in tissues is presented.  Special
   consideration is given to the uptake of vitamin A by the liver and
   its storage in hepatocytes and Kupffer's cell and in subcellular
   organelles.  Data on the concentration of vitamin A in the liver of
   victims of accidental death and the effect of diseases of several
   etiologies are presented.  The mechanism by which liver stores of
   retinyl esters are mobilized and released to the plasma remains
   obscure.  Considerable information has been gained recently on the
   mechanism by which retinol is transported in blood.  Studies leading
   to the isolation and characterization of retinol transport proteins
   are summarized.  The metabolism of retinol binding protein in health
   and in disease, especially in cystic fibrosis, is discussed.
   Finally, some factors of importance to the interpretation of plasma
   levels in terms of vitamin A are reviewed.  Special attention is
   given to the effect on plasma levels of retinol and the retinol
   transport proteins of periods of rapid growth (correlations with age)
   and the influence of dietary adequacy on the distribution of plasma
   levels of the vitamin.

AB The pulmonary macrophages collected with bronchial mucus from
   patients with cystic fibrosis and other chronic lung diseases were
   investigated histochemically for acid phosphatase,
   beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosaminidase activity, and also for
   mucopolysaccharide content.  In macrophages from patients with
   cystic fibrosis decreased beta-glucuronidase activity was observed,
   together with large cytoplasmic vacuoles suggesting storage of
   partially digested material.  It thus seems very likely that apart
   from the increased synthesis of mucopolysaccharides described in
   cystic fibrosis by several authors, the degradation of

AB HL-A frequencies of 28 patients with cystic fibrosis and of 240
   unrelated controls were compared.  No statistically significant
   difference of HL-A frequencies could be observed for both groups.  A
   slightly increased HL-A 2 frequency is considered a chance
   phenomenon.  In accordance with a previously demonstrated lacking
   association of the ABH blood group substances no correlation with
   certain HL-A antigens was demonstrable.
