AB Sweat from 8 'rusters' and 8 control persons was examined for its
   sodium concentration. Sweating was induced by iontophoresis of
   pilocarpine on the distal forearm. In no case did the concentrations
   exceed the normal upper limit for this procedure, and no difference
   was found between the two groups. In this way the study failed to
   confirm earlier reports of elevated sodium chloride concentrations in
   sweat from 'rusters'. Proposals of a relationship between 'rusters'
   and patients with pancreatic cystic fibrosis were not substantiated.
   Hyperhidrosis of the palms and volar surfaces of the fingers was
   present in all 'rusters'. This seemed to be the main cause of the
   corrosive tendency, and patients referred for palmar hyperhidrosis
   were found to produce corrosion similar to the 'rusters'. Topical
   application of aluminium chloride hexahydrate in a 25% solution in
   absolute ethyl alcohol proved effective against both hyperhidrosis
   and the corrosive tendency.

AB 111 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), aged 7 months to 29 years,
   were examined to detect inflammatory middle ear diseases. 35% had a
   history of one or more attacks of acute otitis media, an incidence at
   the same level as in non-CF patients. None had chronic suppurative
   otitis. Only 4 out of the 88 patients able to cooperate in audiometry
   had a hearing impairment. In 2, the hearing loss was perceptive, in 3
   very mild, and in the fourth case, moderately severe. The middle ear
   pressure was measured in 108 patients, in 86 of whom it proved
   normal. In 15 patients the middle ear pressure was lower than--100
   mmH2O, indicating tubal occlusion, and in 7 patients the impedance
   minimum was lacking, indicating an accumulation of mucus. These 7
   patients (6%) had secretory otitis media. Nasal polyps were or had
   been present in 32%. There was no correlation between nasal polyps
   and tubal occlusion or secretory otitis. The incidence of
   inflammatory middle ear diseases in CF patients was in the same range
   as in non-CF patients, a finding at variance with some previous
   investigations showing middle ear pathology in 25--48%.

AB Serum from normal persons and from 133 cystic fibrosis patients was
   examined for precipitins against faecal bacteria (E. coli and B.
   fragilis) and against P. aeruginosa by means of crossed
   immunoelectrophoresis.  27% of the normal sera contained 1-2
   precipitins against E. coli, 16% contained one precipitin against B.
   fragilis and 6% contained one precipitin against P. aeruginosa.  In
   sera from cystic fibrosis patients, there was a significantly
   increased prevalence of precipitins against E. coli (76%), B.
   fragilis (38%) and P. aeruginosa (63%), and the mean number of
   precipitins against each of these bacteria was 3 (range: 1-12), 1.4
   (range: 1-4), and 16 (range: 1-60), respectively.  Increased numbers
   of precipitins against P. aeruginosa were correlated with chronic
   lung infection caused by this species and with poor prognosis,
   whereas such associations were not revealed as regards precipitins
   against the two other bacterial species.  Increased numbers of
   precipitins against E. coli and B. fragilis were significantly
   associated with increased numbers of precipitins against P.
   aeruginosa.  It is suggested that this association is due to immune
   reactions in the intestinal mucosa, resulting in increased
   absorption of antigens from the gut.

AB The coexistence of cystic fibrosis (CF) and coeliac disease (CD) is
   reported in eight children, the odds against this occurring in the
   same child being 1:2 million to 1:5.9 million.  In Sweden, it would
   be around 1:3 million (incidence of CF 1:3000 and of CD 1:1000).
   The coexistence of these two diseases is thought to be chance,
   although CF might predispose to the development of CD.  In a 10-year
   period (with 33405 live births), we observed three children with
   exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and small intestine dysfunction.

MJ CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: pp.  INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE.
MN HUMAN.  INFANT.
EX Although the mechanism proposed by Dr Katznelson for the increased
   intracranial pressure observed in three infants with cystic fibrosis
   cannot be discounted, another explanation is possible.  It has been
   reported previously that a deficiency of vitamin A may predispose to
   development of increased intracranial pressure and bulging
   fontanelles in cystic fibrosis.  Finally, it is somewhat difficult to
   understand how such marked airway obstruction which produced
   increased intracranial pressure could occur with preservation of
   arterial blood gases. - Vitamin A and carotene blood levels were not
   determined in our cases and therefore obviously this possibility
   cannot be excluded, at least in two of the cases.  Dr Taussig's
   suggestion that the improvement in the intracranial pressure in our
   cases was really the result of the "unknowing" associated
   administration of vitamin A and not to the improvements in the
   pulmonary status, as I proposed, fails to note the clinical
   observation that there had been a "rise and fall" in the bulge of the
   fontanel concomitantly with the increase and decrease of respiratory
   obstruction signs.  As to the question of the severity of airway
   obstruction, the clinical reversible picture of severe tachypnea with
   poor air entry, clear lung fields on X-ray with overdistended lungs
   and small heart appear most suggestive of airway obstruction in C.F.

AB Serum and sputum sol phase from 23 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF)
   were examined for occurrence and titres of precipitins against
   Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus by means of crossed
   immunoelectrophoresis with intermediate gel. The patients had from
   four to nine H. influenzae precipitins in serum and in most cases
   fewer precipitins in sputum, but, on an average, there was no
   difference between the titres of the antibodies in serum and sputum.
   Most of the antibodies were cross-reactive with other species,
   notably those of the Haemophilus genus. S. aureus precipitins were
   generally found in higher numbers in serum than in sputum, but, on an
   average, the titre of the precipitins in sputum was higher than in
   serum. Three of the precipitins were detectable only in sputum and
   not in serum, and one of these is a S. aureus-specific precipitin.
   Most of the antibodies were cross-reactive with other species, and
   these antibodies were often present in sputum in much higher titres
   than in the corresponding sera. Antibodies against teichoic acid of
   the S. aureus cell wall could not be demonstrated in sputum, while
   they were present in 22 sera. The possible role of the local
   pulmonary humoral immune response in protective immunity and in the
   pathology of the lung disease in CF is discussed.

AB Eleven cystic fibrosis (CF) patients chronically infected in the
   lungs with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa and presenting multiple
   precipitins in serum against this bacterium (CF + P) and 10 CF
   patients without P. aeruginosa infection (CF-P) had their serum and
   sputum sol phase specimens examined for antibodies of the IgA and IgG
   classes against surface antigens of P. aeruginosa by means of an
   indirect immunofluorescence technique. Both the IgA and IgG antibody
   titres demonstrated in serum and sputum of the CF + P patients were
   significantly higher than in those of the CF-P patients (p less than
   0.01). The titre of IgA antibodies in the sputum was higher than in
   serum in 3 cases indicating local pulmonary production of specific
   IgA antibodies. The role of the demonstrated antibodies in the local
   pulmonary immune defense mechanisms and the possible patogenesis of
   the pulmonary tissue damage in CF patients is discussed.

AB 14 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients chronically infected with mucoid P.
   aeruginosa and presenting multiple precipitins in serum against this
   bacterium (CF + P) and 13 CF patients without P. aeruginosa infection
   (CF-P) had their plasma and sputum sol phase examined for albumin,
   Clq. C3/C3c, C4 and C5 by means of electroimmunoassays. Their sputum
   sol phase was examined also for factor B by
   rocketimmunoelectrophoresis. C3c was demonstrated in the sputum sol
   phase but significantly more frequent (p less than 0.01) among the CF
   + P patients than among the CF-P patients. Factor B was also
   demonstrated in the sputum sol phase, but no significant difference
   in frequency could be demonstrated between the CF + P and the CF-P
   patients. None of the results indicated that a local pulmonary
   production of complement factors took place. Complement activation
   was significantly (p less than 0.01) associated with inflammation
   expressed as increased (formula: see text). The results show the
   importance of complement mediated inflammation in the pathogenesis of
   pulmonary tissue damage in patients with CF and support the concept
   of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection as an immune complex disease
   in CF patients.

AB Sera from 89 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 88 control
   persons were examined for the occurrence of rheumatoid factors (RF)
   of the IgG, IgA and IgM classes by an indirect immunofluorescence
   method and by the latex fixation slide test. The prevalence of RF-IgG
   was significantly higher (88%) (p less than 0.0005) among the CF
   patients than among the control persons (7%), while no difference was
   found between the two groups with regard to RF of the IgA or IgM
   classes. Fifty-five of the CF patients had chronic Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa infection in their lungs and two or more precipitins
   against these bacteria in their sera determined by crossed
   immunoelectrophoresis. These CF patients did not differ from the 34
   CF patients without chronic P. aeruginosa infection, neither with
   regard to prevalence nor titer of RFs, but there was a positive
   correlation between the number of P. aeruginosa precipitins in the 55
   chronically infected CF patients and their titers of IgG-RF. Nineteen
   CF patients were examined also for RFs, antinuclear antibodies (ANA)
   and anti-DNA antibodies in their sputum sol phase and corresponding
   sera. RFs were demonstrated in the sputum sol phase from 6 of the
   patients by the latex fixation test, whereas their sera were negative
   in this test, possibly indicating a local production of RF. Positive
   reactions for ANA and anti-DNA antibodies were found in 7 and 10 of
   the sputa respectively, and in higher titers than in the
   corresponding sera, also suggesting a local production. Titers of
   autoantibodies in sputum were low and no difference was found between
   patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection and patients without P.
   aeruginosa infection. The possible role of autoantibodies in the
   patogenesis of pulmonary tissue damage in CF patients is discussed.

EX This chapter deals with the problems of chronic obstructive lung
   disease in children by first considering an approach to the
   evaluation, diagnosis and management of various forms of chronic
   obstructive lung disease with emphasis on history, physical and
   laboratory data.  A brief overview of therapeutic principles that can
   be applied to most forms of chronic obstructive lung disease are
   included.  The second part of this chapter consists of reviews of
   some of the more common diseases producing chronic airway obstruction
   in infancy and childhood.  Patient evaluation topics discussed
   include history and physical examination and laboratory studies.
   Therapeutic principles in the management of chronic obstructive lung
   disease, pediatric precursors of chronic obstructive lung disease,
   and chronic obstructive lung disorders (asthma, cystic fibrosis,
   bronchopulmonary dysplasia, aspiration pneumonitis, atelectasis,
   bronchomalacia and tracheomalacia, immunodeficiency, bronchiectasis,
   chronic bronchitis, and chronic upper airway obstruction with
   hypoventilation) are examined.

EX Meconium is the first gastrointestinal excretion normally expelled by
   the neonate.  This review discusses the composition of meconium:
   proteins, lipids, steroid and sterols, bile pigments and bile acids,
   glycoproteins, mineral composition, and enzymes.  The major
   complications relating to meconium are serious: they include
   aspiration pneumonia, which may prove fatal and is not related to
   cystic fibrosis, the "meconium plug syndrome" and meconium ileus.
   Screening for cystic fibrosis is also examined.

AB Oral zinc supplementation with 100 mg zinc sulfate over an 8-week
   period in 36 patients with cystic fibrosis and 17 siblings did not
   affect the vitamin A transport system, as evidenced by an absence of
   consistent and significant quantitative changes in plasma levels of
   vitamin A, retinol-binding protein, and zinc, nor did the exogenous
   zinc appear to stimulate growth or exert any clinical benefit to the
   cystic fibrosis patients. The lack of response to zinc
   supplementation might be explained by the fact that the group of
   cystic fibrosis subjects studied was fairly healthy in regard to
   clinical status and certain blood parameters, including zinc.

AB Fecal fat, bile acids, and the rectal microflora were studied in
   seven control children and in three groups of patients with cystic
   fibrosis (CF).  Seven were off antibiotics, ten on oral cloxacillin,
   and six on i.v. triple therapy (cloxacillin, gentamycin, and
   carbenicillin) for at least 2 weeks.  Controls had lower
   concentrations (milligrams per gram dry stool) of both fat (P <
   0.005) and vile acids (P < 0.025) than CF children off antibiotics.
   Antibiotics had little or no effect on fat but led to a striking
   decrease (P < 0.01) of bile acids in the triple therapy group.
   Concomitantly, there was reduced deconjugation of bile acids (P <
   0.01) and formation of secondary bile acids (P < 0.005).  This was
   associated with a 5-fold increase in the percentage of bile acids
   found in the aqueous phase of stools and with a marked reduction (P
   < 0.001) of the anaerobic flora (log counts per gram wet stool) in
   children on triple therapy (4.3 plus or minus 1.9) when compared to
   controls (9.8 plus or minus 0.1), CF off antibiotics (9.1 plus or
   minus 0.1) and CF on cloxacillin (9.6 plus or minus 0.2).  The close
   relationship between the anaerobic flora, the extent of bile acid
   microbial transformation, and fecal bile acid concentrations suggest
   that reduction of the anaerobic flora decreases adsorption of bile
   acids to dietary residues and microbes, favors bile acid absorption,
   and leads to a decreased fecal loss of bile acids in CF.

AB Measurements of serum bile acids (glycine conjugates of cholic,
   chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, and lithocholic acids) by
   radioimmunoassay in a variety of pediatric hepatobiliary disorders
   showed elevations in neonatal hepatitis syndromes, cholestasis, and
   hepatitis of extrahepatic or intrahepatic origin. Measurements of
   individual serum bile acids failed to differentiate between the
   various neonatal hepatitis syndromes. In one patient with
   cholestasis, the increased levels of bile acids observed returned to
   normal following therapy with cholestyramine and phenobarbital. In
   chronic active hepatitis the serum bile acid values correlated well
   with the bilirubin and SGOT in response to therapy with
   corticosteroids. These data confirm suggestions that serum
   cholylglycine and chenodeoxycholylglycine levels are a sensitive
   indicator of disturbed hepatic function and can be used in monitoring
   the course, activity, and therapeutic response in various hepatitis
   syndromes. In Reye's syndrome and protracted diarrhea of infancy,
   elevations in serum bile acids were detected without associated
   hyperbilirubinemia and provided additional evidence of disturbed
   hepatic function.

AB The chloride electrode sweat test and gravimetric chloride titration
   technic are compared. The two technics gave comparable mean values,
   ogives, equivalent points, and overlap for patients with cystic
   fibrosis and healthy subjects. As a single test with either technic
   has an unacceptable risk for false-positive or false-negative
   results, tests should always be done in pairs. A statistical
   interpretation technic based on prevalence and technical variability
   of the two tests will decrease the number of undiagnosed subjects and
   will define probability of cystic fibrosis in the undiagnosed group.

AB Potential sources of error in the Gibson and Cooke method of sweat
   testing using gauze and filter paper as collection media as
   described. The absolute chloride content of gauze was higher than
   that of filter paper; however, the variability of chloride contents
   between the two was insignificant. Complete chloride elution from
   filter paper requires more time than elution from gauze. A method of
   determining probability of a clinically acceptable measurement based
   on sweat sample size, chloride determination, and variability of
   chloride in collection media is also described.

EX We describe two infants with previously undiagnosed cystic fibrosis
   who had electrolyte depletion, metabolic alkalosis, and dehydration
   in the winter and three infants known to have CF in whom similar
   manifestations developed.  We confirm previous reports that salt
   depletion and metabolic alkalosis do occur throughout the year in the
   northern United States and England.  When metabolic alkalosis and
   hypoelectrolytemia in infancy are not explained on the basis of other
   clinical conditions, CF should be suspected.  Pediatricians should
   measure serum electrolyte values promptly and consider early
   parenteral fluid and electrolyte therapy as a preventive measure for
   infants with CF with persistent vomiting and/or diarrhea.

AB Bone mineral content, bone width, and their ratio were measured in
   patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) using monoenergetic photon
   absorptiometry. Serial measurements of the radius and ulna were made
   in 27 patients with CF and were compared with 968 age-matched
   controls. Demineralization was found in 37% of the boys and 63% of
   the girls. Patients under age 10 years had normal bone mineral
   content and nine of 15 patients aged 13 or older were demineralized
   (P less than .01). Demineralization correlated with the extent of
   weight reduction in patients (P less than .001). Patients most likely
   to be demineralized were adolescent girls. To our knowledge, this is
   the first report of bone mineral status of children with CF, and the
   results indicate that a sizable proportion of these patients may be
   demineralized without overt rickets.

AB This article describes the first time-limited psychosocial support
   group for adults with cystic fibrosis (CF).The chronology of the
   group is traced, focusing on issues of importance for health
   professionals who work with patients with CF. Some of the issues
   raised by patient members include doubts about the competence of
   nonpediatricians to adequately treat CF; resentment towards "normals"
   (those without CF), including health professionals; and the desire to
   control as many areas of their lives as possible. Covert (ie,
   unrecognized) issues, the role of staff, risks, and outcome are
   detailed as a guide for others who may wish to conduct such groups.
   The literature on groups for medical patients and a rationale for the
   beneficial effects on the group are given.

AB Cystic fibrosis is now the most common cause of chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD) and of pancreatic insufficiency in the
   first three decades of life in the United States.  In this report we
   describe 75 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 18 to 47 years and
   review another 232 cases reported in the literature.  All of these
   307 patients had elevated sweat chloride and sodium levels, which
   proved excellent discriminants for cystic fibrosis even in patients
   in the older age group.  COPD, present in 97 per cent, was the major
   cause of morbidity and mortality, and differed from COPD of other
   etiologies.  The progressive downhill course in these patients was
   punctuated by recurrent symptomatic exacerbations of chronic
   bacterial bronchitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
   Staphyloccocus aureus, and terminated in pulmonary insufficiency,
   cor pulmonale and death.  COPD was complicated by minor hemoptysis
   in 60 per cent, massive hemoptysis in 7 per cent and pneumothorax in
   16 per cent, problems rare in children.  Sinusitis was present in
   all those examined roentgenographically, and 48 per cent had nasal
   polyposis.  Pancreatic insufficiency was present in 95 per cent of
   the patients, but in contrast to younger patients it was seldom
   symptomatic although steatorrhea and azotorrhea were still massive.
   Intussusception and meconium ileus equivalent (fecal accumulation)
   are frequent in adults (21 per cent) but rare in children, and they
   require immediate diagnostic and therapeutic intervention with
   enemas of diatrizoate sodium.  Glycosuria, biliary cirrhosis,
   cholelithiasis and aspermia were among other complications.  Height
   and weight were usually within the lower limits of normal, but 17
   per cent of the men were above 180 cm in height and 7 per cent were
   overweight.  Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed to make
   the diagnosis, because older patients with cystic fibrosis may look
   quite well.

EX Turner and associates cited cystic fibrosis as an example of the
   application of the judicious use of genetic counseling and prenatal
   diagnosis.  The reader who is unfamiliar with genetic disorders,
   prenatal diagnosis, and genetic counseling may have taken the "cystic
   fibrosis example" as fact rather than a model, as intended.  Cystic
   fibrosis is a recessive disorder for which prenatal diagnosis and
   heterozygote detection are not yet possible.  Currently, because of
   the present inability to detect the heterozygous state, genetic
   counseling of individuals with a family history of cystic fibrosis
   frequently means a statistical prediction is given, rather than a
   precise recurrence risk.

AB The development of the exocrine pancreas has been determined
   quantitatively in 31 infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) both  with and
   without meconium ileus and in 29 control infants. In the normal
   pancreas, the ratio of acinar to connective tissue volume is 0.5 at
   32 weeks postconceptional age (PCA) and increases linearly to 2.0 at
   52 weeks PGA. In cystic fibrosis infants, with or without meconium
   ileus, the ration is 0.5 at 35 weeks PCA  anddecreases linearly to
   0.3 at 52 weeks PCA. The volume of acinar and duct lumens is greater
   in CF than control infants but is independent of age or acinar
   volume. The development of the exocrine pancreas in infants with CF
   with and without meconium ileus diverges from the normal pattern:
   There is consistent lack of exocrine tissue before or a full-term
   birth, which persists throghout the age range of this study. CF
   infants above 42 weeks PCA can be discriminated from controls on the
   basis of the quantitative assessment of acinar volume.

AB To investigate the contribution of vagal tone to the obstructive
   airway disease in cystic fibrosis, we evaluated the pulmonary
   function response to administration of 0.1 mg of atropine sulfate
   per kg of body weight, 0.05 mg of isoproterenol hydrochloride per kg
   of body weight, or isotonic saline (control solution) administered
   by nebulization on 3 different days to each of 10 patients with
   cystic fibrosis in a single blind study.  The doses of atropine
   sulfate and isoproterenol hydrochloride were based on published
   dose-response characteristics of the drugs.  Each day, thoracic gas
   volume and airway resistance were measured in a volume displacement
   body plethysmograph, and maximal expiratory flow-volume curves were
   performed before and at 15, 30, and 60 min after the inhalation.
   After inhalation of saline, group mean values for all pulmonary
   functions indicated greater airway obstruction at 15, 30, and 60 min
   when compared to pretreatment values.  After inhalation of
   isoproterenol and atropine, significant improvement (P < 0.05) was
   noted in maximal expiratory flows at 60 per cent of total lung
   capacity, specific airway conductance, thoracic gas volume, and
   residual volume.  Inhalation of atropine also significantly improved
   maximal expiratory flow at 25 per cent of vital capacity.
   Isoproterenol increased the mean flows by 8 to 46 per cent above
   baseline, and decreased thoracic gas volume and residual volume by
   11 to 16 per cent with the maximal response at 15 or 30 min.
   Atropine increased mean flows by 15 to 77 per cent and decreased
   thoracic gas volume and residual volume by 16 to 25 per cent with
   the maximal effect at 30 to 60 min.  The mean response to atropine,
   expressed as a percentage of baseline, was always greater than or
   equal to that for isoproterenol.  We conclude that vagal tone, which
   may reflect increased irritant receptor activity, contributes to the
   obstructive pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis.  Inhalation of
   atropine sulfate will decrease the pulmonary function abnormality,
   but side effects prohibit its clinical usefulness.

EX This account draws on studies of young and mature lung, on normal and
   morbid anatomic features, on normal adaptations as in growth, and
   remodeling by disease.  Qualitative analysis of the vascular bed,
   development of the pulmonary circulation, right ventricular
   hypertrophy or cor pulmonale, remodeling in disease, and experimental
   studies are discussed.  Pulmonary hypertension offers us a complex
   pattern of structural and functional interaction; we are just
   beginning to realize how complex it is.  Information on normal
   structure, its modification and remodeling by growth and disease, and
   appropriate techniques are available that will enable us to formulate
   our questions with due regard for anatomic precision and functional
   implication.  And so research will lead to understanding and, it can
   be expected, to control of the undesirable aspects of pulmonary
   hypertension.

AB Forty-six patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were studied for
   colonization and sensitization by Aspergillus organisms. The fungus
   was cultured from 21 of 37 (57%) patients who produced sputum. The
   non-CF sputum isolation rate was 6.5%. Sputum hyphae were seen in 95%
   of patients with positive cultures. Sputum eosinophilia accompanied
   colonization by Aspergillus. Aspergillus precipitins were found in
   37% of CF patients; positive immediate skin tests were found in 39%.
   "Atopy" defined by skin test criteria was found in 46%. All of these
   findings were more common in patients with more severe disease (p
   less than 0.05). CF patients had predominant mold sensitivity in
   contrast to predominant pollen sensitivity in a control group of
   asthmatic subjects. Serum IgE concentrations were increased in 22% of
   CF patients. CF patients who had increased serum concentrations of
   IgE were more likely to have a family history of atopy. Wheezing was
   more common in those who were atopic, especially the group with
   predominant mold sensitivity who had more severe disease. Four
   patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for allergic
   bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) during the time of study and
   follow-up. A fifth patient had ABPA diagnosed before the study. The
   incidence of ABPA during a 2-yr period in our CF population was 11%.

AB Flows measured from maximal expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves were
   used to evaluate the efficacy of postural drainage in improving
   ventilatory function acutely. Maximal expiratory flow-volume curves
   were obtained for 9 cystic fibrosis subjects and 10 subjects with
   chronic bronchitis before and 5, 15, and 45 min after a 30-min
   session of postural drainage with percussion, vibration, and
   coughing. Forced vital capacity (FVC) was significantly increased 45
   min after drainage for the combining group. Flows at high lung
   volumes were different for the 2 subgroups. Subjects with cystic
   fibrosis demonstrated a significant increase in peak expiratory flow
   rates 45 min after drainage and an increase in forced expiratory
   volume in one sec at all time intervals. The subjects with chronic
   bronchitis had a decreased peak expiratory flow rate 5 min after
   drainage, but by 45 min, it had returned to baseline. There was no
   significant change in one-sec forced expiratory volume at any time
   interval for the chronic bronchitis subgroup. Changes in flows at low
   lung volumes were similar for the 2 subgroups. Forty-five min after
   drainage there was an increase in flow rates near 50 per cent of FVC.
   Flows near 25 per cent of FVC were increased 15 and 45 min after
   drainage. This study demonstrated that postural drainage with
   coughing resulted in significant improvement in flows at low lung
   volumes. Changes in flows at high lung volumes were less consistent.

AB Responses to treadmill exercise of 36 patients with cystic fibrosis
   were studied to evaluate their usefulness in identifying those with
   atopy. Ten of 36 patients with cystic fibrosis (28%) had an abnormal
   response to exercise but had no more frequent atopic characteristics
   than those who had normal exercise responses. Response to treadmill
   exercise alone cannot identify patients with atopic disease among
   those with cystic fibrosis.

AB This review describes the development and application of a novel test
   to determine levels of human immunoreactive trypsin, an enzyme
   produced solely by the pancreas, in biological fluids. Being organ-
   specific, the assay of immunoreactive trypsin should be an ideal
   marker of pancreatic function, and this is supported by the results
   of a number of clinical and research investigations. Use of this
   assay in studies of chronic pancreatitis, juvenile-onset diabetes,
   and cystic fibrosis has yielded much valuable data, and it is
   expected that further research will lead to an improved understanding
   of these and other conditions associated with the pancreas in health
   and disease.

AB In the province of Limburg, all newborn babies are screened for
   metabolic anomalies: for amino acidopathies since 1968, for
   galactosemia since 1974 and for mucoviscidosis since 1978.  On
   127,676 newborns, there were 12 cases of phenylketonuria and 3 other
   inherited anomalies.  A meaningful policy of the government on
   neonatal screening necessarily requires a good organization, to put
   together the screening data, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.

AB Chest physiotherapy still remains one of the most important aspects
   in the treatment of chest complications of cystic fibrosis. A
   mechanical device that allows the patient with cystic fibrosis to do
   his own chest physiotherapy will be of great benefit if it is as
   effective as manual percussion. 14 patients with cystic fibrosis
   using mechanical and manual percussion physiotherapy were studied by
   measuring sputum volumes, and FEV and FVC. Results with mechanical
   percussor were as good as with the manual percussor and, therefore,
   it would be reasonable for the older patient to use the former on his
   own.

AB During a 4-year routine screening programme for cystic fibrosis (CF)
   15 464 specimens were examined for raised meconium albumin levels by
   a test strip method and by electroimmunoassay. The incidence of false-
   positive results was about 5 per 1000 specimens in either test. This
   could be reduced by 90% by determining the ratio of albumin : alpha-1-
   trypsin inhibitor (a ratio below 2.0 being considered as a negative
   result), and it could be reduced to zero by determining the ratio in
   subsequent faecal specimens. Three of 12 meconium specimens from
   infants with proved CF gave false-negative results in all 3 tests.
   The other 9 specimens had greater than 100 mg albumin/g dry weight
   and albumin: alpha-1-trypsin inhibitor ratios of greater than 3.0; in
   subsequent faecal specimens the ratios were over 4.0. 176 meconium
   specimens from elsewhere in the UK were examined and these included
   23 from infants who were subsequently proved to have CF. Six of these
   23 CF specimens gave false-negative results, the other 17 being
   strongly positive. The origins of meconium serum protein suggest that
   infants with CF in whom meconium gives false-negative results have
   normal pancreatic functions at birth. The specificity of current
   meconium tests therefore cannot be improved as they depend on
   pancreatic dysfunction.

   after a test meal. The effects of triolein (TO), bovine serum albumin
   (BSA), and ricinoleic acid (RA) on the absorption of taurocholate
   (TCA) in the distal ileum of the rat in vivo was also studied. The
   mean (and ranges) of total bile salt concentrations, glycine: taurine
   conjugate ratios, and percentage of dihydroxy bile salts in the
   patients with CF and pancreatic insufficiency were 3.5 (1.3--6.6)
   mmol/l, 8.6 (greater than 10-3.1), and 37 (10--60) compared with
   control values of 7.4 (3.0--16.0) mmol/l, 3.0 (1.3--4.5), and 61 (52--
   70) respectively. The differences between the control and CF values
   were statistically significant (P less than 0.01--P less than 0.001).
   Three of the 13 CF patients had total bile salt concentrations less
   than 2 mmol/l, 8 had much higher glycine: taurine ratios, and 8 had a
   reduced percentage of dihydroxy bile salts. In 2 patients with normal
   pancreatic enzyme activities, duodenal bile salts were both
   quantitatively and qualitatively normal. TO (10 and 30 mmol/l), BSA
   (3%), and RA (5 mmol/l) had no inhibitory effect on the ileal
   absorption of TCA. These results show pronounced abnormalities of
   duodenal juice bile salts in CF with pancreatic insufficiency
   consistent with a broken enterohepatic circulation (EHC); such
   abnormalities may contribute to defective lipid absorption in CF. The
   data in the experimental animal do not support the suggestion that
   unhydrolysed dietary substrates play a role in the pathophysiology of
   the broken EHC.

AB An episode of severe small intestinal hemorrhage occurred in a cystic
   fibrosis patient having pancreatic insufficiency and receiving timed-
   release aspirin therapy for disabling hypertrophic pulmonary
   osteoarthropathy. The increased acidity of small intestinal contents
   due to decreased bicarbonate secretion observed in patients with
   pancreatic insufficiency may alter the luminal environment and result
   in mucosal erosions and/or ulcerations in association with the
   presence of aspirin. Thus, physicians should be aware of the
   possibility that timed-release aspirin causes small intestinal
   hemorrhage in such patients.

AB The mucosal epithelium of the middle ear and Eustachian tube is in
   direct continuity with the upper respiratory tract. Since the
   otolaryngological aspects of cystic fibrosis (CF) are dominated by
   involvement of the paranasal sinuses, it might be assumed that
   children with CF would be expected to have a higher than usual
   incidence of middle ear disease. Eighty patients who were afflicted
   with CF had audiological evaluations, which consisted of hearing
   threshold levels (250 to 8,000 Hz) and speech and impedance
   audiometry. We found no greater incidence of a conductive or
   sensorineural hearing loss in patients with CF when compared with a
   normal age-adjusted population.

AB Adolescents with cystic fibrosis were compared with normal
   adolescents of the same age and educational grade on several measures
   of vocational development and adjustment. The cystic fibrosis group
   in ages 12--16 and in grades 7, 8, and 9 scored lower than their
   normal counterparts in measures of vocational and educational plans,
   and were less realistic than normals in considering their limitations
   and financial constraints. In contrast, the cystic fibrosis group at
   nearly all age and grade levels scored significantly higher on
   strength of commitment to vocational choice, work values, and
   awareness of occupational information. Compared to 4 additional
   handicapped groups already studied, adolescents with cystic fibrosis
   scored favorably. They not only plan to work but also hold strong
   work values compared to normals. Rehabilitation programs should
   emphasize preparation for a career and the development of educational
   and vocational plans while the adolescent is still in high school.

AB 6-E1(R)-2-(oxo-imidazolidine-1-carboxamido)-2-phenyl-acetamido]-
   penicillanic acid sodium salt (azlocillin, Securopen) was given in
   doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight to children with cystic
   fibrosis. After intravenous bolus infections, the serum half-life was
   0.82 +/- 0.12 h after the lower dose and 0.98 +/- 0.18 h after the
   higher dose. This was consequent to a dose limited elimination
   kinetics due to limitation in both renal and non-renal processes of
   elimination. Upon doubling of the dose from 100 to 200 mg/kg, the
   total body clearance dropped from 13.93 to 5.10 1/h. Evaluation of
   data presented in other publications indicate that a dose limited
   elimination kinetics is the normal situation for azlocillin. Besides,
   the serum concentrations of patients with cystic fibrosis were
   considerably lower than seen in the healthy state. The reason is
   faster elimination by the renal route in cystic fibrosis.

   This neglect is reflected in a review of the case notes of two

   the interval between the two cases was introduced to the concern of

AB It is confirmed that the level of alkaline phosphatase in fibroblasts
   derived from cystic fibrosis patients can be induced many-fold by
   growing the cells in the presence of Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein. It
   is further shown that normal fibroblasts produce a "CF corrective
   factor" which markedly inhibits this phenomenon. These observations
   support a previous hypothesis on the nature of the metabolic defect
   in cystic fibrosis.

   Heterozygote serum also produced an increased uptake of 45Ca++ but
   not to the same extent as CF serum.  The calcium channel blocker
   D600 inhibited the CF serum induced uptake of 45Ca++ indicating that
   CF serum may be acting on the plasma membrane to produce changes in

AB A novel technique has been employed to demonstrate that alpha-L-
   fucosidase purified from cystic fibrosis and control livers exhibits
   differential binding to the lectin Concanavalin A.  The
   concentration of alpha-CH3-mannoside necessary to prevent 50%
   binding of alpha-L-fucosidase to Concanavalin A is considerably
   lower for the cystic fibrosis enzyme (13.5 vs. 33.3 mM).  Comparable
   results were found when binding studies were done on crude
   supernatant alpha-L-fucosidase from 8 cystic fibrosis and 8 control
   livers (5.6 plus or minus 0.4 mM and 13.2 plus or minus 3.4
   respectively), without any overlap of values between the cystic
   fibrosis and control livers.  These results suggest that comparative
   lectin binding studies on cystic fibrosis and normal glycoproteins
   from readily available tissues might result in an assay for
   detecting the cystic fibrosis genotype.

EX One of the symptoms of cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) is pancreatic
   insufficiency.  The reduced proteolytic activity in the gut of
   children with the disease results in an elevated concentration of
   protein, especially serum albumin, in the meconium.  This feature is
   used in the diagnosis of the disease in the newborn, and we decided
   to examine the utility of enzyme immunoassay for the measurement of
   albumin in meconium samples from normal and cystic fibrosis infants.
   Normal samples were found to have apparent albumin concentrations in
   the range 0.05-0.26 mg/g dry wt., whereas cystic fibrosis samples had
   concentrations in the range 60-230 mg/g dry wt.  The assay provides a
   cheap and relatively rapid method of differentiating cystic fibrosis
   positive and negative meconium samples.

AB The membrane glycoprotein enzyme, alkaline phosphatase was induced in
   cultured human fibroblasts by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, sodium butyrate,
   the serum glycoprotein fetuin, the Tamm-Horsfall urinary
   glycoprotein, and by a number of inhibitors of DNA synthesis. The
   uninduced basal enzyme activity increased at later stages of growth
   when the cells became confluent. Induction by dibutyryl cyclic AMP or
   fetuin was most effective when the agents were added after the cells
   had reached stationary phase and was maximal after at least two days
   of exposure. The levels of induction resulting from the addition of
   pairs of the agents, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, n-butyrate and fetuin were
   additive indicating that these have different modes of action. The
   inhibitors of DNA synthesis, cytosine arabinoside, hydroxyurea, and
   methothrexate were less effective inducers. Bromodeoxyuridine which
   also has non-DNA mediated effects induced to the same extent as
   dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Similar experiments with sex- and age-matched
   cell strains derived from patients with cystic fibrosis failed to
   detect differences in the levels of induction from those observed in
   normal cells. In addition, the combined inductive effects of Tamm-
   Horsfall glycoprotein, isoproterenol and theophylline, were similar
   with normal and cystic fibrosis cells.

AB The lipid composition of isolated plasma membranes of human skin
   fibroblasts is described for the first time. Plasma membranes from a
   number of strains of fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis
   and matched normals were isolated by a recently described procedure
   and analysed for major phospholipid classes, cholesterol and fatty
   acids. No differences in the quantities of these compounds were
   detected between cells of the two different origins. The fetal calf
   serum used to supplement the growth medium contained relatively more
   palmitoleate and oleate but less stearate than the membranes. There
   were also no consistent differences between cystic fibrosis and
   normal membranes in terms of the fatty acid compositions of their
   individual phospholipid classes. Consistent with this lack of
   chemical change in the lipids of membranes of cystic fibrosis cells,
   the degree of fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene, an
   index of fluidity, was also unchanged.

   malformation and polygenic syndromes which make up the bulk of what
   we call birth defects.  Of comparable importance in terms of genetic
   counseling is understanding the origin and incidence of the newly
   recognized genetic heterogeneity lying behind what had previously
   been regarded as simple, single-gene determined diseases.  Topics
   include dealing with genetic heterogeneity, phenotypes and genotypes,
   where genetic causation defies simple analysis, and sources of
   variation.  Behavior disorders with presumptive single-gene causation
   (Lesch-Nyhan disease), presumptive sex-linked causation
   (aggressivity), and presumptive polygenic causation (alcoholism) are
   also discussed.

AB Bronchial artery embolization is a useful palliative treatment for
   life-threatening haemoptyses where surgery is contra-indicated.
   Patients presenting with haemoptyses complicating cystic fibrosis and
   aspergilloma have been embolized. Control of haemoptysis was achieved
   in the former, but late recurrence of haemoptysis in the latter led
   to asphyxiation.

EX Cystic fibrosis is the commonest semilethal genetic disorder in
   Caucasians.  The biochemical sequence that leads to widespread
   dysfunction of exocrine glands has yet to be determined.  Cystic
   fibrosis in adults has been the subject of extensive review.  We
   still do not know the cause of the changes in the lungs.  Pancreatic
   insufficiency was recorded in 95% of the patients, but the older ones
   needed little dietary restriction and some seemed to thrive without
   pancreatic replacement.  Ninety-five per cent of males have aspermia
   due to failure of development of the vas deferens, epididymis, and
   seminal vesicles.  Despite the obvious handicap and emotional and
   social strains in all four series, adolescent and adult patients with
   cystic fibrosis not only did well at school and at work but managed
   to fit in well in their social framework.

MN ADOLESCENCE.  ADULT.  AGED.  HUMAN.  MIDDLE-AGE.  PRESSURE.
AB The force of impact and frequency of percussion by physiotherapists
   and parents of children with cystic fibrosis were analysed on a
   special test rig and incorporated in a prototype percussor. In adult
   volunteers and cadavers a maximum intrathoracic pressure could be
   achieved by a critical frequency of mechanical percussion which was
   higher than that reached by physiotherapists and parents.
   Consequently the percussor was redesigned to operate at this optimum
   frequency. It was then discovered that if the percussor was pressed
   firmly enough against the chest, this maximum intrathoracic pressure
   could be indicated by quivering of the voice. In a continuing study
   of intrathoracic pressures obtained mechanically and manually the
   Salford percussor's produced higher pressures than the
   physiotherapists' and maintained them constantly, while the
   physiotherapists' efforts and results varied from one to another.
   Hospital and domiciliary use of the percussor have shown it to help
   in the first stage of the physiotherapy routine for patients with
   cystic fibrosis. The percussor should enable adolescents and adults
   to treat themselves and encourage twice-daily and more effective
   chest treatments. It is easy to apply and its speed and efficiency
   should enable parents to improve the quality of their chest therapy
   for younger children at home. Its long-term benefits are difficult to
   assess because of the nature of the disease.

   cleared more sputum in less time than conventional physiotherapy. A
   sputum in less time than conventional physiotherapy. A second study
   showed that an assistant did not further improve the results obtained
   by the patient performing the forced expiration technique himself.
   These findings mean that patients with cystic fibrosis who have had
   to rely on the help of others for their home treatment may now
   perform more effective treatment without help. The forced expiration
   technique might also be helpful for patients with chronic bronchitis,
   asthma, or bronchiectasis.

EX The control of symptoms in dying children is often sadly neglected.
   This neglect is reflected in a review of the case notes of two
   children who died of cystic fibrosis within three years of each
   other.  The girls were under the care of the same consultant, who in
   the interval between the two cases was introduced to the concept of
   proper terminal care for children.  These two cases show that illness
   can cause physical, emotional, and spiritual pain to family and
   staff.  In retrospect these areas of distress were not clearly
   defined in either case and opportunities to alleviate suffering were
   missed.  The principles of controlling symptoms need to be remembered
   as much during distressing treatment as during the distress of dying.

   malnutrition.  We describe our experience of the long-term use of
   continuous nocturnal infusion of elemental diet in a patient with
   cystic fibrosis.  Our patient tolerated the long-term nocturnal
   elemental diet well, and it enabled her to continue normal
   everyday activity and eat normal meals.  The periods of nutritional
   support coincided with periods of increased body weight and total
   body potassium, indicating that the lean body mass was increased.
   We think that these results show a need for further studies of home
   treatment in children with cystic fibrosis.

AB Static lung volumes (VC, TLC, FRC, RV), elastic recoil pressure of
   the lungs (Pst(1) at 100, 90, and 60% of TLC), static lung compliance
   [Cst(1)], specific airway conductance at FRC level (Gaw/TGVex),
   forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), maximal
   expiratory flows (Vmax.) at 25 and 50% of VC and at 60% of TLC, and
   "upstream" airway conductance (Gus) at 60% of TLC were studied in 28
   patients with cystic fibrosis, 5 to 25 years old, over a period of 1
   to 5 years. The data were compared individually with normal values,
   related to body height in the form of regression equations and
   expressed in percentage of predicted values. From the indices
   assessing airway function, Vmax. at low lung volumes, Gus at 60% TLC,
   RV and RV/TLC were the functional parameters most consistently
   abnormal. Among the indices characterizing lung elasticity, Pst(1) at
   60% TLC was the most abnormal. Generally, the values of the majority
   of lung function indices [VC, TLC, FRC, Pst(1)] declined during
   growth. Vmax. at all lung volumes and Gus at 60% TLC did not
   deteriorate with growth probably due to the great abnormality of
   these parameters already in young patients. It was also observed that
   lung function did not change significantly over a period of 1 to 5
   years corresponding to a 10 cm increase in body height. However, over
   that period, lung function improved in some of the subjects, did not
   change in over 50% of the cases and deteriorated in the others.

EX This study investigated the roles of hypoxia, pulmonary mechanics,
   nutritional status and serum fatty acid composition in limiting
   exercise tolerance in cystic fibrosis.  Twenty children with CF of
   carrying severity performed two progressive exercise tests on a cycle
   ergometer, once while breathing air, once while breathing O2. The
   children with the lower maximal mid-expiratory flow rates tended to
   have very little respiratory reserve at the final work load.  We
   conclude that nutritional status and airway obstruction are closely
   correlated with exercise tolerance in CF and that, unlike the adult
   with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, exercise limiting
   dyspnoea occurs in the presence of normal end-tidal CO2.

EX This chapter focuses on the application of radionuclide
   angiocardiography to assessment of right ventricular ejection
   fraction and the relationship between right and left heart
   performance demonstrated by this technique.  Prior to discussion of
   the clinical applications, the functional geometry of the two
   ventricles will be reviewed.  In addition, the first-pass radiotracer
   techniques will be compared to other radionuclide imaging approaches
   of the right heart.  First-pass radionuclide angiocardiographic
   techniques are now suitable for clinical application.  They have been
   validated and standardized and can be relied upon for accurate,
   reproducible noninvasive assessment of right and left ventricular
   performance.  They already have been applied to the study of patients
   with cardiopulmonary disease; future directions will include earlier
   evaluation of myocardial infarction, application to children and
   adults with a variety of congenital cardiac abnormalities (primarily
   those affecting the right heart), and assessment of the effects of
   physiologic stress upon right ventricular function.  With this
   background valuable clinical and investigative insights should become
   available during the coming years.

AB Of 97 well-defined strains of Pseudomonas, isolated from sputum of
   patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the minimum inhibitory
   concentration (MIC) of several antibiotics was determined with a
   broth dilution method. The majority of the strains were resistant to
   ampicillin and cephalothin, moderately susceptible to carbenicillin
   (70% to 100 microgram/ml) and highly susceptible to piperacillin
   (100% to 25 microgram/ml, 88% to 6.25 microgram and 60% to 3.12
   microgram/ml). If the pharmacological properties of piperacillin are
   comparable with those of carbenicillin, it can be expected that the
   sputum level of this drug will be adequate to treat Pseudomonas
   pulmonary infections. At the lowest concentration tested (0.78
   microgram/ml) 3% of the strains were susceptible to kanamycin, 85,5%
   to amikacin, 95% to gentamicin, 98% of tobramycin, and 80% to

AB In this echocardiographic study, assessment of the heart in children
   with cystic fibrosis has shown that changes occur in not only the
   right ventricle but also in the left ventricle and aorta, as compared
   with normal. Echocardiograms could be successfully performed in 34 of
   37 patients. The thickness of the right ventricular anterior wall and
   the dimension of the right ventricular cavity  were abnormal, even in
   patients with mild disease (National Institutes of Health [NIH] score
   for severity of disease of 85 or greater). Larger, older children
   with lower NIH score had disproportionately larger right ventricular
   anterior walls and cavities. The thickness of the septal wall, the
   thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall, and the aortic
   dimensions were increased in those with severe disease. The
   dimensions of the left ventricular cavity for the population were
   slightly but significantly smaller than normal in systole and in
   diastole throughout the course of the disease. This study
   demonstrates that echocardiography is an effective noninvasive means
   of assessing the long-term changes in children with cystic fibrosis.
   These changes occur in both sides of the heart and appear to worsen
   as the disease progresses.

EX In the present study, we compared the levels of a series of cultured
   lymphocytic acid-hydrolase enzymes in cystic fibrosis homozygotes,
   heterozygotes and controls; compared the effects of three different
   mitogens on these levels; and studied the effect of CF vs control
   serum in the culture medium.  Our observations provide an entirely
   new interpretation for the apparent changes occurring in lymphocytic
   enzymes during culture of lymphocytes with mitogens, and suggest that
   a serum factor is present in cystic fibrosis serum that mimics
   mitogens in this regard.  Lymphocytic acid-hydrolases and total
   protein are present in higher concentrations in lymphocytes cultured
   for 48 hours without mitogen when CF homozygous or heterozygous serum
   is present in the culture media.  This appears to result from a CF
   serum factor that has mitogen-like activity and prevents loss of cell
   protein during culture.  Responsiveness of the cellular proteins to
   mitogens is blunted when CF serum is present in the culture media,
   either because the cell proteins are already maximally stimulated by
   the CF serum factor, or the factor blocks or modifies the action of
   mitogens on lymphocyte protein content.  This phenomenon is useful
   for detection of CF heterozygosity, and appears to reflect the
   genetic abnormality causing cystic fibrosis.

AB This study demonstrates the clinical feasibility of atraumatically
   measuring dynamic regional lung function with tetrapolar electrical
   impedance plethysmography (EIP) in the pediatric age group. A
   tetrapolar electrode system was used because of its ability to detect
   local baseline and pulsatile impedance changes, minimal electrode-
   tissue impedance interference, and uniform current distribution.
   Studies performed on 4 children 4 to 15 years old with various
   pulmonary diseases are presented. The information obtained on their
   regional ventilation and pulsatile perfusion by EIP was found to
   agree closely with pulmonary ventilation and perfusion scans. In one
   case, EIP detected pulsatile perfusion abnormalities which were not
   apparent in the non-pulsatile perfusion scan but were demonstrated by
   cineangiography. It is concluded that tetrapolar EIP can provide
   safe, reliable regional information about ventilation and perfusion
   in diseased lungs, and because of its atraumatic approach, is
   technically most suitable for use in children.

AB To explain why the single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity
   (Dsb) was, on the average, elevated in 163 asthmatic subjects and 175
   patients with cystic fibrosis, we simulated this elevation in ten
   normal subjects by having them perform the test for Dsb through an
   inspiratory obstruction. This resulted in an 18 percent increase in
   Dsb corrected for pulmonary volume. Inhalation of a bronchodilator
   drug was associated with relief of obstruction and a fall in the
   corrected Dsb in 31 asthmatic subjects but did not change either the
   obstruction or the corrected Dsb in 17 patients with cystic fibrosis.
   We suggest that elevated Dsb in asthma and cystic fibrosis is partly
   due to maximal inspiration against obstructed airways. This requires
   abnormally negative intrathoracic pressures, increasing the pulmonary
   capillary blood volume, and, thereby, increasing the Dsb.

AB An echographic study was undertaken to evaluate left (LV) and right
   ventricular (RV) function in 30 patients with cystic fibrosis.
   Echographic recording of the pulmonary and aortic valve echogram
   permitted measurement of the phases of right and left ventricular
   systole. The ratio of the LV preejection period/LV ejection time
   (LPEP/LVET) and shortening of the LV internal dimension %SID was
   employed to reflect LV function, while RV preejection period/RV
   ejection time (RPEP/RVET) has excellent correlation with pulmonary
   artery diastolic pressure. RPEP/RVET and two other echographic
   measurements, right ventricular wall (RVW) and internal dimension
   (RVD) were compared with pulmonary function tests and clinical
   scores. RPEP/RVET correlated well with percent vital capacity(%VC), r
   = -0.73, percent residual volume (%RVol) r = +0.72, and clinical
   score, r = -0.77. Multilinear regression of RPEP/RVET, RVD, and RVW
   improved correlation for %VC (r = -0.80), %RVol, r = +0.82, and
   clinical score, r = -0.84. Patients in overt right heart failure
   exhibited elevated RPEP/RVET (mean = 0.48) when compared to patients
   not in right heart failure (mean = .33). Marked diminution of LV
   function was present in two patients. A variety of cardiovascular
   abnormalities were demonstrated echographically and were valuable in
   assessing the degree of cardiac involvement in patients with cystic
   fibrosis.

AB Ten of fifteen cystic fibrosis children with positive skin prick
   tests to common antigens gave an immediate bronchial reaction to the
   antigen inhaled, five of them also gave a late reaction; however only
   one gave a history of asthma. The antigen most commonly eliciting a
   positive skin reaction in cystic fibrosis patients is Aspergillus
   fumigatus. In six children tested to this antigen the bronchial
   response varied, two were negative, one gave an immediate reaction
   and three gave a dual (immediate and late) reaction. None of the
   children showed the characteristic pattern of response to exercise
   seen in asthmatic patients, an initial rise in Peak Expiratory Flow
   Rate followed by a fall of greater than 14% below the resting level.
   Two patients showed an abnormal rise in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate
   during exercise, a pattern described previously in cystic fibrosis.
   The results suggest that bronchial allergy, immediate or late does
   completely explain susceptibility to asthma, and that other factors
   including perhaps the type of bronchial reactivity shown by
   bronchoconstriction after exercise may be required. However the
   majority of the children tested had bronchial allergy and anti-
   allergy therapy such as inhaled sodium cromoglycate may have a place
   in the management of selected patients with cystic fibrosis.

AB On exposure to pancreatic extract (PE), four parents of cystic
   fibrosis (CF) children developed immediate hypersensitivity-like
   symptoms: i.e. rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, and/or anaphylaxis. IgE
   to PE was demonstrated in the subjects by skin testing, leucocyte
   histamine release and radioallergosorbent test (RAST). No serum
   precipitating antibodies were found. Bronchial challenge caused an
   immediate asthmatic response. No delayed asthmatic response or
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like reaction occurred. The responsible
   antigen for PE induced asthma is unknown; trypsin failed to inhibit
   PE-RAST and is therefore not responsible in these subjects. Caution
   should be exercised in using PE for skin testing and bronchial
   challenge in subjects with suspected hypersensitivity to PE. Certain
   measures were found useful in preventing the occurrence of symptoms
   in the four subjects.

AB We evaluted measurement of urinary 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid as a
   potential screening method for small-bowel disease and bacterial
   overgrowth syndromes in 360 unselected acutely ill infants and
   children. Control data were obtained on 120 healthy children, ages
   1.5 to 15 years, from a general medical practice, 48 healthy infants,
   ages one to five years, from local day nurseries, and 150 healthy
   babies, ages less than one to eight days. Comparative data were from
   300 acutely ill hospitalized babies and children, ranging in age from
   less than one day to 15 years and without clinical evidence for small-
   bowel disease and bacterial overgrowth syndrome. No false-negative
   results and only 2% false-positive results were observed. Among the
   10 patients whose urinary excretion of the analyte was considered to
   be abnormal were patients with Giardia lamblia infestation, ileal
   resection with blind loop, and other diseases of the small intestine
   associated with bacterial overgrowth. We conclude that measurement of
   4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid excretion is useful in screening for such
   diseases.

AB The sweat test, correctly performed, appears to be reliable, but
   results were found to be unreliable about half the time in 84 small
   community hospitals assessed. The reasons are inexperienced and
   untrained technicians, the infrequency of test performance, the use
   of unstandardized equipment, and the lack of appropriate standards.
   It behooves all clinical laboratory directors to re-examine and
   standardize their procedures and use the recommendations of the
   Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Physicians should be made aware of the
   current situation and send their patients only to laboratories that
   perform the test reliably.

AB Secretion of the lysosomal enzyme beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC
   3.2.1.30) by normal and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts has been
   compared. In contrast to an earlier report, no differences were found
   in either the rate of secretion, or in the molecular forms of the
   enzyme secreted by normal fibroblast cultures and cultures initiated
   from patients with cystic fibrosis. The B isoenzyme of beta-N-
   acetylglucosaminidase from cystic fibrosis fibroblasts was converted
   to a more negatively charged form during preincubation for 3 h at pH
   5.0 and 37 degrees C. The enzyme from normal fibroblasts was
   unaffected by this treatment.

AB In a study of eight glycosidases in serum samples from 72 cystic
   fibrosis patients, 85 cystic fibrosis parents and 34 healthy and
   diseased controls, significant elevations of mean alpha-glucosidase
   levels were found in cystic fibrosis patients. All other glycosidases
   did not show any significant change. Mean alpha-glucosidase levels in
   obligate heterozygotes were the same as in control individuals.
   Moreover, alpha-glucosidase levels in cystic fibrosis patients
   correlated with the degree of clinical impairment as measured by the
   Schwachman score.

AB Enzyme activity against hippuryl-L-arginine was studied in cultured
   skin fibroblasts from controls and cystic fibrosis patients. The
   enzyme had a lysosomal distribution and an acid optimum of pH 4.5
   with little or no activity present above pH 7.0. Dithiothreitol was
   required for full activity and the kinetics of thiol activation were
   different for the control and cystic fibrosis enzyme. The properties
   and lysosomal distribution of the enzyme indicated that it was a
   carboxypeptidase B. Substrate affinity, thermolability, pH stability,
   the fall and rise in activity with subculture, the cyclical pattern
   of activity through serial passage and the level of activity were
   similar for the control and cystic fibrosis enzyme.

AB Purified preparations of plasma alpha 2-macroglobulin from patients
   with cystic fibrosis are shown to have normal amounts of total hexose
   but as much as 40% decrease in their sialic acid content. The binding
   of these preparations to concanavalin A and wheat-germ agglutinin was
   markedly reduced as compared to normal values in controls.
   Intermediate values were found in obligate heterozygotes. These
   results suggest a possible alteration in the carbohydrate moiety of
   alpha 2-macroglobulin in cystic fibrosis, presumably due to a
   defective posttranslational process.

AB The activity of alpha-L-fucosidase is decreased in the serum of
   cystic fibrosis patients when compared to age-matched controls. This
   result, combined with the elevated activity in skin fibroblasts,
   supports the concept of an abnormal intracellular and extracellular
   distribution of alpha-L-fucosidase in cystic fibrosis.

AB Cultured skin fibroblast and primary amniotic fluid cell alpha-L-
   fucosidase had a double optimum of pH 5.0 and 6.0. Alpha-L-fucosidase
   was largely bound as a single peak to DEAE-cellulose at pH 6.6.
   Sucrose density isoelectric focusing revealed up to seven components
   with pI values of 4.9, 5.2, 5.4, 5.8, 6.1, 6.5 and 7.1 with their
   apparent KM values (77--500 mumol/l) being higher than that (57
   mumol/l) of the unfocused enzyme. Liver, skin fibroblast and amniotic
   fluid cell alpha-L-fucosidase was separated into two peaks by gel
   filtration. Peak one was more active and stable at low pH and more
   thermostable at 50 degrees C than peak two, while both peaks had an
   apparent KM of 52 mumol/l. Apart from the different proportions of
   the peaks separated by gel filtration, the results for the three
   tissues were similar. The properties of alpha-L-fucosidase studied
   were similar for control and cystic fibrosis liver or skin
   fibroblasts.

AB Tests to demonstrate a preference by mosquitoes for stinging controls
   as opposed to obligate heterozygotes for Cystic Fibrosis proved
   negative. If a heterozygote advantage caused a lower malarial
   incidence in carriers in South West Africa, it must have worked
   through the malarial parasite being adversely affected by a serum
   factor. This remains to be tested.

   HUMAN.  ARGININE-CARBOXYPEPTIDASE: bl.  MALE.
AB Serum from 95 patients with cystic fibrosis and 47 control subjects
   without cystic fibrosis was analyzed for carboxypeptidase B-like
   activity in the presence of optimal concentrations of Co2+ ion,
   hippuryl-L-lysine and serum.  Fourteen of the cystic fibrosis
   patients had no steatorrhea and therefore minimal pancreatic
   dysfunction.  Patients with cystic fibrosis and controls were of
   comparable age.  Serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity was
   significantly decreased in cystic fibrosis patients including cystic
   fibrosis patients without steatorrhea.  Significantly low values
   were found in both male and female cystic fibrosis patients when
   compared with controls of similar sex.  Although values were
   unaffected by age in the control population, values in older
   patients with cystic fibrosis were significantly lower than values
   in younger patients.  No correlation was obtained between serum
   carboxypeptidase B-like activity and pulmonary or hepatic function.
   Serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity therefore falls with
   progression of the disease and may limit the ability to degrade
   circulating peptides in older patients with cystic fibrosis.
   Deficient serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity is less likely,
   however, to be a factor in the development of the early
   manifestations of the disease.

AB A false-positive 111In-labeled leukocyte scan was obtained in a girl
   with cystic fibrosis and infection. There was focal accumulation of
   111In activity in the abdomen and marked pulmonary uptake. Surgical
   exploration and postmortem examination revealed no abdominal
   abnormality. The abnormal activity was apparently due to swallowed
   sputum which contained labeled leukocytes. Broader clinical
   implications are discussed.

AB 1. The mucus glycoproteins in meconium from normal infants and from
   infants having cystic fibrosis with meconium ileus have been studied.
   2. Whereas normal meconium contained about 50% protein-bound
   carbohydrate, the meconium from cystic fibrosis contained only about
   10%. 3. Glycopolypeptides were prepared from the mucus of
   glycoproteins. The oligosaccharide units from this material were
   released and fractionated. The fractions ranged widely in size and
   composition. 4. The fractions from cystic fibrosis specimens had a
   significantly higher content of fucose than those from normal
   specimens.

EX Infection with the gram-negative bacillus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is
   less common than infections with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
   pneumoniae, and Proteus sp; however, the mortality associated with
   pseudomonas sepsis exceeds that found with the more commonly isolated
   gram-negative bacilli by a considerable margin.  While explanations
   exist for this increased virulence of pseudomonas, including
   secretions of toxic exoproducts and a high degree of antibiotic
   resistance, the precise reasons for such unfavorable clinical
   experience with this organism are uncertain.  The current interest in
   pseudomonas infection is partly due to the ever-increasing numbers of
   immunosuppressed and granulocytopenic patients seen in clinical
   practice.  The organism, pathogenesis, clinical presentations (burn
   patients, nosocomial infections, immunosuppressed patients, cystic
   fibrosis), and therapy are discussed.

EX There are certain aspects of the symptomatology of cystic fibrosis
   that bear a resemblance to those of essential fatty acid deficiency.
   We fed a group of patients essential fatty acids orally since
   intravenous administration is not a practical method for long term
   treatment.  Results of the study were varied.  Although some response
   was noted in all patients, there were no consistent clinical changes
   seen in every patient.  The oral EFA therapy effected no change in
   sputum cultures.  After one year of EFA, the sweat sodium
   concentration was lower in all but one patient.  The clinical aspect
   of our study is small, but promising.  The results suggest a role for
   EFAs in the care of CF.  Whether EFA is a factor in the etiology of
   CF or merely a manifestation of malabsorption requires further
   investigation.

AB In 28 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 5--24 years the values of
   maximum expiratory flow rates (Vmax) at lower volume levels were
   assessed, as well as the "specific" conductance of the respiratory
   pathways (Gaw/TGV), the vital capacity (VC), total lung capacity
   (TLC), residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC),
   RV/TLC and FRC/TLC ratios and the one-second forced expiration of the
   vital capacity (FEV1) to evaluate obstruction of the respiratory
   pathways. Most markedly and most frequently abnormal were the values
   of Vmax, RV and of the RV/TLC ratio. These findings revealed that in
   almost all patients with CF there was already during the initial
   examination an obstruction of the peripheral respiratory pathways and
   hyperinflation of the lungs. During repeated measurement of the above
   values of lung function in 15 patients with cystic fibrosis during a
   period of 1--5 years when the patients increased in height by 10 cm
   on average, the above values did not deteriorate on average. There
   was, however, an individual variability of the investigated values
   during this period. The comprehensive treatment provided in our
   country prevented in patients with CF a deterioration of obstruction
   of the respiratory pathways during the period of investigation.

EX As far as I know, no test for the prenatal diagnosis of cystic
   fibrosis has yet been shown to be reliable, but several experimental
   studies on prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis are being carried
   out.  Deficient protease activity, assayed by 4-methylumbelliferyl
   guanidinobenzoate, an active site titrant of serine proteases, has
   been reported in plasma and cultivated skin fibroblasts from patients
   with cystic fibrosis.  Another prenatal diagnostic test for cystic
   fibrosis involves the observed resistance of patients' skin
   fibroblasts to dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) toxicity,
   in comparison to normal fibroblasts.  Specific induction of alkaline
   phosphatase with Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein, isoproterenol and
   theophylline has been recorded in skin-derived fibroblasts from
   affected patients.

AB Protease activity in plasma is assayed using 4-
   methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate. The assay is modified by
   carrying out the reaction in the presence and absence of benzamidine,
   a competitive inhibitor of trypsin-like proteases. The parameters of
   the assay are described in detail. Using this assay, our earlier
   demonstration of a deficiency of protease activity in plasma of
   patients with cystic fibrosis is confirmed. The activity, corrected
   for the nonspecific hydrolysis of 4-
   methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate by benzamidine, is expressed as
   nanomoles of 4-methylumbelliferone released per milliliter plasma.
   Under standard conditions, the activity in plasma activated with
   chloroform-ellagic acid was 127.2 +/- 23.1 in 7 controls, 70.4 +/-
   11.7 in 11 obligate heterozygotes, and 48.7 +/- 16.6 in 12 patients
   with cystic fibrosis. Identical results were obtained when
   unactivated plasma was used. These data demonstrate that the
   judicious use of specific inhibitors such as benzamidine might be
   useful in assaying low levels of protease activity in crude systems.

AB To nine cystic fibrosis patients with chronic bronchopulmonary
   infection of severely damaged lungs invaded by Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa, eleven courses of prolonged tobramycin treatment (5
   mg/kg/day) for four to 16 weeks were administered. Pulmonary symptoms
   improved and a better quality of life was achieved in all but one
   patient. Objective parameters (chest X-ray, pulmonary function tests)
   changed to a lesser extent. In only one patient was Pseudomonas
   eradicated from the sputum but reappeared after discontinuation of
   therapy. In the rest of the patients Pseudomonas was significantly
   suppressed or replaced by other pathogens. Four patients showed rises
   of antibody titres to Candida and two to Aspergillus fumigatus. No
   nephrotoxic side effects were observed, but vestibular function was
   reversibly impaired in one patient without corresponding clinical
   symptoms. No bacterial resistance to tobramycin was observed during
   therapy.

AB Clinical and radiological findings, quantified by special scores, in
   36 patients with cystic fibrosis are compared with lung function
   measurements, including the ratio of RV/TLC and FEV/VC and the
   arterial blood gases at rest and during exercise. Although
   respiratory function tests were found to correlate well with both the
   pulmonary finding score and the chest radiographic score, distinction
   of three severity groups was possible only by a vector calculation of
   the blood gases in PaO2-PaCO2-diagram, at rest and during exercise.
   Thus, measurements of pO2 and pCO2 at rest and on exercise appear to
   be a helpful adjuvant to routine spirometry for the individual
   appraisal of the degree of lung involvement, performance and care
   level.

AB Quantitative and functional assessments were made of both the
   classical and alternative pathways of complement activation in sera
   from 23 patients with cystic fibrosis. The classical pathway
   functioned similarly in patients and controls as measured by CH50
   titre. Alternative pathway function, initiated in patient sera by
   incubation with inulin, was equal to that of controls as determined
   by cleavage of Factor B and C3, and by the consumption of terminal
   components. Factor B, however, was more readily activated in patient
   than in control sera. This rapid alteration of Factor B did not lead
   to accelerated or more extensive activation of the terminal
   complement components via the alternative pathway when assessed by C3
   cleavage and the consumption of terminal components. Thus, a
   complement deficiency was not found. The importance of the easily
   activated Factor B is undefined.

AB Using radioimmunoassay, immunoreactive SP (iSP) has been measured in
   the plasma of 162 hospital patients with various disorders and in the
   plasma of 67 pregnant women. In pregnancy, iSP was undetectable in
   40% women as compared to 12% in other hospital patients. The mean iSP
   plasma level in pregnancy was 37.8 +/- 4.6 (SEM) as compared to 77.1
   +/- 4.9 (SEM) pg/ml in other hospital patients. The results support
   earlier observations based on bioassay, suggesting that the blood of
   pregnant women contains higher concentrations of a SP-inactivating
   factor. Of the hospital patients, elevated levels of iSP were found
   in patients with chronic leukaemia, in one patient with a basaloid
   carcinoma of the anus, and in one patient with toxic liver damage and
   pancreatic insufficiency. No correlation was found between thyroid
   function and iSP plasma levels. ISP plasma levels in various
   gastrointestinal disorders were similar to those found in normal
   subjects.

AB The short circuit current rat jejunum bioassay, first employed in an
   attempt to discern the cystic fibrosis (CF) serum "factor," was
   evaluated using sera from patients with pancreatic disease.  The
   data suggest other pancreatic diseases, specifically genetic
   diabetes and alcoholic pancreatitis, also present with a serum
   "factor" (or "factors") which reduce the short circuit current of
   rat jejunum, an effect very similar to that of the CF serum
   "factor."  A large number of sera from presumed normal subjects also
   exhibited a significant reduction in short circuit current; these
   (false positives) represent a yet to be defined mechanism, however,
   they do decrease the likelihood that the observed effect is merely
   due to pancreatic destruction.  Detailed procedure and equipment
   specifications for the bioassay system are included.

AB In vitro lymphocyte responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been
   found to be impaired in cystic fibrosis patients with advanced
   clinical disease. The responses to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia
   marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis were studied in a similar group of
   cystic fibrosis patients and normal individuals. Cystic fibrosis
   patients found to be unresponsive to pseudomonas were also
   unresponsive to klebsiella, serratia, and proteus. Responsiveness to
   Staphylococcus aureus was not impaired in cystic fibrosis patients.
   We postulate that in vitro lymphocyte responses to several gram-
   negative bacteria require the function of a lymphocyte subpopulation
   which may be impaired in some cystic fibrosis patients.

AB The bacteriological effect of chemotherapy against mucoid strains of
   Pseudominas aeruginosa in the lower respiratory tract of patients
   with cystic fibrosis is reported. A comparison of the effect of high
   doses of tobramycin (10 mg/kg/24 h) given alone or in combination
   with carbenicillin showed a significant difference in favour of the
   combination therapy. In 74.5% of the initially successful courses the
   patients were recolonized within one month. Fifty-three patients were
   examined by audiometric and vestibular tests. Only in one patient was
   it possible to register a transient, high tone hearing impairment at
   8000 Hz bilaterally, that might be attributed to the tobramycin
   treatment. It is concluded that high dose tobramycin treatment in
   children and adolescents with normal kidney function implies only a
   minimal clinical risk of adverse ototoxic effects, even after
   repeated courses of treatment. No nephrotoxic side-effects were found
   in this material.

EX It is the purpose of this review to present evidence for a disorder
   which is believed to be caused by defective cilia and to review some
   data on the occurrence of abnormal cilia, evidently formed in
   response to environmental insults.  The cilium, human ciliated
   structures, the immotile-cilia syndrome and other inborn ciliary
   diseases, cystic fibrosis, and acquired disorders of ciliated
   structures are discussed.  Ciliary activity is not vital, but its
   loss will cause a great deal of discomfort.  The greatest problems
   relate to the lower respiratory tract, which is also a site of most
   of the cilia in the body.  It is striking that a certain degree of
   clearance can be maintained in the lungs in the absence of motile
   cilia by coughing, hawking, and other mechanisms.

   were examined with audiometric and vestibular tests, and in one
   patient, a 10-year-old girl, we found a transient high tone loss at
   8000 Hz bilaterally that might be attributed to the tobramycin
   treatment.  All patients had normal kidney function.  High dose
   tobramycin treatment in children with normal kidney function gives
   minimal clinical risks of adverse ototoxic effects, even after
   repeated courses of treatment.

AB Three main reasons have been advanced for the degree of ignorance
   and confusion surrounding epidemiologic measures of the incidence
   and prevalence of Cystic Fibrosis. (CF)  Relatively recent
   recognition of CF as a specific disease entity.  Wide range of
   clinical manifestations, presentation as a multisystem disease, and
   great natural variation in the severity of involvement of various
   organs.  Past difficulty in establishing a diagnosis based on sound
   laboratory evidence, this being largely due to the lack of a
   screening test that had gained wide acceptance among diagnosticians,
   and inaccuracies in the performance and interpretation of the sweat
   test.  In addition to these factors, there are a number of
   methodological deficiencies and questionable assumptions in several
   of the papers that have here been reviewed.  It may be noteworthy
   that the two sets of authors whose research design most closely
   matched being aimed at providing multiple ascertainment of cases and
   cross-checks of validity, have arrived at nearly the same estimated
   incidence of this particular disorder (1/3700 and 1/3800
   respectively).  The issue of selection and diagnostic criteria is
   one that has important implications for epidemiologic studies of
   cystic fibrosis.  Particularly in a disease like CF, where the
   spectrum of clinical manifestations and severity of involvement is
   so broad, estimates of incidence will vary according to the criteria
   by which cases are ascertained and included.  A greater degree of
   uniformity in standards than has been employed in previous studies
   is necessary before comparisons can meaningfully be made.  There are
   good grounds for regarding most estimates of CF incidence to be
   minimum confirmed figures, and this is particularly so where the
   research design ensures that multiple ascertainments of the same
   case will be identifiable.  Higher estimates are made where several
   sources of error (respondent bias, generalization of hospital data
   to the wider population, multiple ascertainments of the same
   patient) are not recognised.

AB The impact of the death of a cystic fibrosis child on subsequent
   family function was evaluated in a retrospective study of 16
   families.  In findings similar to that reported for another model of
   fatal childhood illness, leukemia, there was a high incidence of
   emotional and medical problems in the parents.  There was an
   unexpectedly high incidence (7/16) of incomplete mourning, i.e.,
   maintenance of the child's room as a shrine or weekly grave visit
   for more than six months.  Siblings had less difficulty in adjusting
   to the loss than that reported for the siblings of leukemic
   children.  It is suggested that the prolonged course of a disease
   with a hopeless prognosis prepares the family for the child's death
   but also retards the mourning process.  The family may need
   counseling to ensure that mourning is completed.

AB Factors that influence hemoglobin (Hb)Aic synthesis by intact
   erythrocytes were studied in vitro.  After incubation cells were
   lysed, and hemoglobins were separated by isoelectric focusing on
   polyacrylamide slab gels and quantitated by microdensitometry.
   HbAic increased with time, glucose concentrations (5-500 mM) and
   incubation temperature (4 degrees-37 degrees C).  Low temperatures
   allowed prolonged incubations with minimal hemolysis.  At 4 degrees
   C HbAic increased linearly with time for 6 wk; after incubation at
   the highest glucose concentration, HbAic comprised 50% of total
   hemoglobin.  Insulin (1 and 0.1 mU/ml) did not affect HbAic
   synthesis in vitro.  In addition to glucose, galactose and mannose,
   but not fructose, served as precursors to HbAic.  A good substrate
   for hexokinase (2-deoxy-glucose) and a poor hexokinase substrate
   (3-O-methyl-glucose), were better precursors for HbAic synthesis
   than glucose, suggesting that enzymatic phosphorylation of glucose
   is not required for HbAic synthesis.  Autoradiography after
   erythrocyte incubation with 32P-phosphate showed incorporation of
   radioactivity into HbAia1 and HbAia2, but not HbAib, Aic, or A.
   Acetylated HbA, generated during incubation with acetylsalicylate,
   migrated anodal to HbAic and clearly separated from it.
   Erythrocytes from patients with insulinopenic diabetes mellitus
   synthesized HbAic at the same rate as controls when incubated with
   identical glucose concentrations.  Likewise, the rate of HbAic
   synthesis by erythrocytes from patients with cystic fibrosis and
   congenital spherocytosis paralleled controls.  When erythrocytes
   from cord blood and from HbC and sickle cell anemia patients were
   incubated with elevated concentrations of glucose, fetal Hb, HbC,
   and sickle Hb decreased whereas hemoglobins focusing at isoelectric
   points near those expected for the corresponding glycosylated
   derivatives appeared in proportionately increased amounts.

AB A phenotypic characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from single
   sputum samples of 21 typical cystic fibrosis patients indicated a
   high frequency of heterogeneity among isolates on the basis of
   differences in antibiotic resistance, colony morphology,
   pigmentation, and serotype.  Two or more isolates with different but
   stable susceptibilities to carnecillin, gentamycin, streptomycin,
   tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole plus
   trimethoprim were detected in 38% of the sputa.  Differences
   generally were independent of the mucoid state of the strain.  O-
   antigen group determination with the Difco typing set showed that
   two or more serologically distinct strains were present in 10/21
   sputum specimens.  Nonmucoid derivatives of mucoid isolates almost
   always retained both the antibiotic susceptibilities and serotype of
   their parent strain.  These data suggest that cystic fibrosis
   patients may be cocolonized/coinfected by difference strains of P.
   aeruginosa more frequently than generally believed.  Alternatively,
   phenotypically distinct strains from a single patient might arise as
   phenotypic dissociants from a single infecting strain.  Because of
   the frequency and multiplicity of phenotypically distinct P.
   aeruginosa isolates which we obtained from our cystic fibrosis
   patients, it is important to select multiple isolates from sputum
   cultures for antimicrobial susceptibility testing so as to assess
   adequately the susceptibility of this organism to antibiotic therapy
   in cystic fibrosis.  We recommend that several colonies of each
   distinguishable colony type of P. aeruginosa be pooled for the
   antibiogram.

AB The dietary problems associated with the care of chronically sick
   children can be considered under two broad headings.  First, there
   are the problems in those children for whom diet is an essential
   part of the treatment of their chronic disorder; and second there
   are nutritional complications which may occur in children with
   chronic diseases in which diet does not have a specific role in
   treatment, and is thus often neglected or considered only at a later
   stage of management.  Many of the problems are of course common to
   both situations.  This paper will review briefly some of the
   difficulties, illustrating these with specific examples; no attempt
   will be made to describe or discuss the treatment of any particular
   disorder.

EX Inborn errors of metabolism are conditions in which the body fails to
   metabolise certain chemicals due to an inherited enzyme deficiency.
   The inborn errors of metabolism considered in this paper are those
   which affect the metabolism of dietary nutrients and which require
   manipulation of the carbohydrate intake.  In these cases the need for
   sugar - either as a source of energy when other energy-supplying
   nutrients have to be suppressed, or for the control of hypoglycaemia
   - is vitally important.  Inborn errors of protein metabolism include
   phenylketonuria, maple-syrup urine disease, organic acidaemias, and
   hyperammonaemia.  Inborn errors of fat metabolism  include
   abetalipoprotinaemia, type I lipoprotein-lipase deficiency, and
   lymphangiectasia.  Inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism include
   diabetes, galactosaemia, fructosaemia, and glucose-6-phosphate
   deficiency (type I glycogen storage disease).  Inborn errors of
   multiple nutrients include cystic fibrosis.  Dietary carbohydrate,
   psychological considerations, and dental caries are examined.

   IMMUNOTHERAPY.
AB Acute pseudomonas infections require treatment with antibiotics
   producing a bactericidal effect. The most useful are gentamicin,
   tobramycin, sisomicin and polymyxin B. In resistant strains, amikacin
   is indicated in addition. Carbenicillin, ticarcillin, carfenicillin
   or azocillin should never be given alone but in combination with some
   of the above preparations. Other drugs, such as chloramphenicol,
   tetracycline or streptomycin, though effective in vitro, should be
   avoided. Chemotherapy may be complemented by passive immunization
   either with hyperimmune specific gama globulin or hyperimmune plasma.
   A programmatic item of combined treatment is active immunization,
   especially with toxoid vaccine. Chronic processes are not, perhaps
   with the exception of urinary infections, suitable for antibiotic
   therapy. For this reason effective polyvalent vaccines should be
   developed from appropriate strains. It is now certain that in
   infections caused by mucous strains (most frequently encountered in
   cystic fibrosis) the vaccine should be prepared from these strains,
   since they have distinct functional and antigenic characteristics.

AB Clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients with cystic
   fibrosis were studied in an effort to determine the unique
   characteristics of the infecting strains and to elucidate the pattern
   of colonization. Of 413 patients studied, 81% were chronically
   infected with P. aeruginosa. Patients from whom P. aeruginosa was
   never or only occasionally isolated were in better clinical condition
   than the chronically infected patients. Isolates were classified into
   six morphologic varieties: classic, rough, mucoid, gelatinous, dwarf,
   and enterobacter. Most patients had two or more of these varieties.
   Such multiple varieties from the same individual were of the same
   serotype but often differed in antibiotic susceptibility as
   determined by both the disk and the minimal inhibitory concentration
   methods. These differences were apparent when mucoid strains were
   compared with nonmucoid strains and when nonmucoid strains were
   compared with one another. Studies of antibiotic susceptibility
   should be performed on each morphologically different type of P.
   aeruginosa obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis.

EX Cystic fibrosis is currently the most common fatal hereditary disease
   of the Caucasian race.  The lack of effective oral antibiotics
   against Pseudomonas aeruginosa precludes either systemic treatment or
   suppression, in an outpatient setting, of the chronic pseudomonas
   bronchitis typically seen in CF patients.  Because of the central
   role of infection, and particularly pseudomonas infection, in the
   sequence of events that leads to respiratory failure and death in CF,
   currently available information regarding the pathogenesis of
   infections caused by P. aeruginosa was emphasized and discussed at a
   workshop on infections in patients with CF, sponsored by the National
   Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., on
   January 9 and 10, 1979.

AB Although N-acetyl-L-cysteine (Mucomyst) is an effective mycolytic,
   numerous investigations have failed to demonstrate a consistent
   improvement in pulmonary mechanics following its use. In order to
   determine whether its beneficial mucolytic activity might be
   counterbalanced by a deleterious direct effect on cilia, we studied
   its effect on the activity of ciliated epithelium in the ferret
   tracheal organ culture system. N-acetyl-L-cysteine consistently
   caused progressive time-dependent ciliostasis at concentrations
   clinically employed, with complete ciliary paralysis within 8 hr. The
   effect was only partially reversed by the removal of the drug.
   Control preparations retained full ciliary activity for 3 to 12
   weeks. In order to determine the active site on the N-acetyl-L-
   cysteine molecule, we investigated the ciliostatic effects of five of
   its chemical analogs. Isomolar N-acetyl-L-alanine was not
   ciliostatic, indicating the necessity of a sulfhydryl group for
   activity. Ciliostasis was independent of isomeric structure,
   acetylation, and chain length, as evidenced by the similar
   ciliostatic effects of L-cysteine, D-cysteine, 2-mercaptoethylamine,
   and N-acetyl-L-homocysteine. We conclude that N-acetyl-L-cysteine
   induces partially reversible ciliostasis of tracheal epithelium via
   its sulfhydryl group; prolonged use of this drug may impair
   mucociliary clearance.

   survival of individuals with cystic fibrosis as well as discuss the
   pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of this multisystemic disease.
   The reasons for the improved prognosis in CF are multiple: improved
   antibiotic therapy, early diagnosis, specialized care centers, and
   aggressive treatment regimens.  This presents the primary care
   physician with a new and challenging patient population, requiring
   the coordinated effort of the health care team, including
   specialists, nurses, therapists, etc., to achieve effective therapy
   for this truly multisystemic disease.

EX Attempts to identify the carrier state for cystic fibrosis (CF) or to
   make a prenatal diagnosis of CF have been unsuccessful.  One approach
   to this problem is to look for associations between known genetic
   markers and the locus for CF.  In general these studies have looked
   at the frequency of HLA types in patients with CF and have failed to
   demonstrate a strong association.  We attempted to look for linkage
   between HLA haplotypes and CF in families with more than one affected
   member.  The segregation of HLA in these affected sibpairs vary
   little from the expected.  Although the sample size is small, it is
   unlikely that a close linkage exists between the HLA loci and the CF
   locus.

EX A 5-month-old white girl was admitted to an Infant Intensive Care
   Unit of Jackson Memorial Hospital.  According to her mother, the baby
   had been in "her usual state of health" until one week before
   admission, when she began to "spit up" after feedings and her lower
   extremities became puffy.  Vomiting increased in frequency until it
   occurred after every meal; eventually the baby refused all feedings;
   there was no diarrhea.  Ultimately, the family's physician, when
   consulted, recommended that she be admitted to the hospital.  On the
   fourth day she developed renal failure with anuria and rising
   creatinine concentration despite adequate fluid intake; peritoneal
   dialysis was begun.  However, she soon became hypothermic and
   developed pulmonary edema, and she died a few hours later.  A
   discussion of the case is presented.

EX Mitchell and co-workers conclude that bronchial hyperreactivity is
   common in cystic fibrosis (CF) but is different from that in asthma.
   Their data were interesting, but I do not agree with their
   conclusion.  One can interpret these data as suggesting a common
   reversible component in both patient groups, and perhaps a common
   denominator in mechanism.  Because of certain problems with baseline
   measurements and withholding of medication, it seems that the
   conclusion of Mitchell et al may not be well supported. - We felt
   justified in studying those patients with a low baseline FEV (forced
   expiratory volume in one second), since a subject's bronchial
   response to methacholine remains stable even if these is moderate
   fluctuation both in initial specific airway conductance and in the
   severity of the disease.  We feel that withholding the drug for a
   longer period would not have affected the comparisons.  Although
   there might be a common underlying mechanism in bronchial
   hyperreactivity in asthma and cystic fibrosis, our data showed a
   number of differences between the two groups of patients.  Although
   these differences would not exclude a common mechanism in bronchial
   hyperreactivity in the two diseases, the existence of the differences
   should lead to caution in concluding that there is a common
   underlying mechanism in the bronchial hyperreactivity in the two
   diseases.

EX We report on the examination of stimulated pancreatic secretion using
   4-(N-acetyl-L-tyrosyl)aminobenzoic acid in children with cystic
   fibrosis.  In controls the urinary excretion of 4-aminobenzoic acid
   amounted to 54.8 +/- 11.7% with 19.6% as the lower limit of normal
   during six hours, and 74.7 +/- 10.8% and 40.5% during eight hours.
   In children with cystic fibrosis the mean values were 5.6% in the
   six-hour test and 13.7% in the eight-hour test.  Both values are
   significantly different in comparison with controls.  It may be
   assumed that both 4-(N-acetyl-L-tyrosyl)aminobenzoic acid and
   4-(N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl)aminobenzoic acid are suitable for indirect
   determination of exocrine pancreatic secretion in children.

AB Ten patients (6 to 27 years of age) who had severe pancreatic
   exocrine insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis were studied to
   determine whether cimetidine would improve dietary fat and nitrogen
   absorption. When a constant diet was consumed and oral pancreatic
   enzymes were administered, the addition of cimetidine (150 or 200 mg
   taken orally one-half hour before meals) signficantly reduced fecal
   fat excretion from 25.3 +/- 2.9 to 17.3 +/- 2.1 gm/24 hours and fecal
   nitrogen excretion from 4.5 +/- 0.6 to 3.4 +/- 0.5 gm/24 hours (P
   less than 0.05). Lower doses of cimetidine resulted in less
   significant reductions of steatorrhea and azotorrhea. Cimetidine may
   be a useful adjunct to oral pancreatic enzyme therapy in patients
   with cystic fibrosis who continue to have steatorrhea and azotorrhea
   with enzyme therapy alone.

AB The prominent role of infection in the clinical course of cystic
   fibrosis has led to considerable investigation of possible immune
   deficiency in these patients.  Leukotaxis of circulating phagocytic
   cells and the ability to generate chemotactic factors are important
   in host defenses against bacterial invasion.  These properties were
   investigated in patients with clinically stable cystic fibrosis to
   determine if they possess dysfunctional inflammatory responses which
   would predispose them to severe infection.

EX Davidson et al report hyperuricemia in cystic fibrosis patients
   ingesting large quantities of pancreatic extracts.  This article and
   others emphasize the considerable purine content of these
   preparations as causal to the increased serum and urine uric acid
   levels in patients who consume them.  This may find clinical
   application, since uric acid production from RNA might be decreased
   by an inhibitor of ribonuclease.  While itself a purine chain,
   polyadenylic acid added to pancreatic extracts may prevent the
   hydrolysis of mixed-base ribonucleic acid to uric acid precursors,
   while allowing the beneficial effects of the other pancreatic enzymes
   to prevail. - A number of weaknesses to the proposal bears stressing
   before we begin giving polyadenylic acid to our patients.  No one
   knows whether nucleic acids are malabsorbed in cystic fibrosis.  If
   polyadenylic acid produces only 70% inhibition of pancreatic
   ribonucleases at a one-to-one ratio of substrate and inhibitor, a
   relatively enormous amount of polyadenylic acid would have to be fed
   with the pancreatic extracts.  If there were an intestinal enzyme
   capable of cleaving polyadenylic acid, the treatment would add to,
   not subtract from, the purine load.  Finally, Stapleton et al's
   results suggest that more than 75% of the purine load in the
   pancreatic extracts would probably be absorbed anyway.

AB Severe bronchial hemorrhage in 13 patients with cystic fibrosis was
   treated by catheter embolization of bronchial arteries. Indications
   were either excessive bleeding persisting for several days, or
   bleeding serious enough to interfere with pulmonary drainage and
   recurring over weeks or months. In follow-up ranging from one to 30
   months, cessation of major bleeding was achieved in 12 of 13 patients
   (93%), although 5 of 13 patients (40%) did have recurrence of minor
   hemoptysis. No neurologic or other major complications were
   encountered. However, there are potential risks and this approach at
   present should be limited to patients with life-threatening bleeding
   and carried out only by experienced angiographers.

EX The report by Huff, Huang, and Arey again calls attention to the
   heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis and to the fact that a properly
   performed sweat test in the normal or borderline range does not rule
   out cystic fibrosis.  This may occur in approximately 1% of patients
   we classify as having cystic fibrosis and confirms our original
   impression that the sweat test has a reliability of between 98% and
   99%.  One must pay close attention to the clinical picture, the
   family history, and especially the pulmonary or gastrointestinal
   findings, and provide rational treatment until more acceptable
   evidence of the disease can be documented.  In the same issue is a
   report on a false positive sweat test in a Canadian patient with the
   Mauriac syndrome.  The authors list a variety of conditions that have
   been reported as yielding elevated sweat electrolytes.  The manner of
   the collections can greatly influence the result. - In patients with
   transient abnormal sweat electrolytes, sodium values were
   consistently higher than chloride values.  Perhaps the finding of
   sodium values in excess of chloride in the abnormal range suggests a
   false positive test.

TI 25-Hydroxycholecalciferol levels in patients with cystic fibrosis.

MJ CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: bl.  HYDROXYCHOLECALCIFEROLS: bl.
MN HUMAN.  VITAMIN-D: ad.
EX Assessment of the status of circulating vitamin D in cystic fibrosis
   patients was investigated by determining serum levels of
   25-hydroxycholecalciferol.  The majority of the patients with CF and
   pancreatic insufficiency had levels of 25-OH-D within the normal
   range.  Clinical symptoms or pathologic signs resulting from
   deficiencies of vitamins A and E in patients with CF have been
   repeatedly documented.  In contrast, a paradoxical lack of vitamin D
   deficiency signs has been observed in CF patients.  This is
   especially puzzling since rickets had been commonly associated with
   most other forms of steatorrhea.  We can only speculate why rickets
   was formerly rarely reported in association with CF.  Perhaps because
   of voracious appetites and the selective absorption of vitamin D via
   the lymphatics without requiring esterification, these individuals
   were spared clinical rickets.

AB Vitamin D and mineral metabolism were studied in 21 adolescents and
   young adults with cystic fibrosis and the results were compared to
   those in 21 matched controls. All CF patients had been maintained on
   standard multivitamin supplements in combination with pancreatic
   enzyme replacement. Despite this supplementation, relative to control
   subjects the CF patients had a 36% reduction in serum 25-
   hydroxyvitamin D concentration, a slight but significant reduction in
   serum calcium concentration, evidence of calcium malabsorption with
   secondary hyperparathyroidism, and a 14% decrease in bone mass
   measured by the photon absorption technique. Currently accepted modes
   of pancreatic enzyme replacement and vitamin D supplementation are
   often inadequate to maintain normal mineral homeostasis in CF
   patients; additional measurements may be required to reduce the risk
   of clinically significant osteopenia concomitant with prolonged
   survival in CF.

EX Steatorrhea is a prevalent gastrointestinal manifestation of cystic
   fibrosis.  Although deficiencies of vitamins A, E, and K have been
   described in patients with this disease, vitamin D deficiency and
   rickets have rarely been reported.  The major form of vitamin D,
   cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), is produced by ultraviolet irradiation
   of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin.  Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is
   a product of plant ergosterol.  We studied the vitamin D status of
   patients with cystic fibrosis by measurement of the serum
   concentrations of the major circulating metabolites of vitamin D:
   25-hydroxyvitamin D and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  The mean serum
   concentrations of total 25OHD, 25OHD3, and 24,25(OH)2D and
   25OHD3/25OHD ratios in patients with cystic fibrosis were similar to
   values recorded in control subjects.  The present study demonstrates
   that the serum concentrations of the major metabolites of vitamin D
   in patients with cystic fibrosis are similar to those in healthy
   subjects.

EX This paper presents additional evidence of the variability and
   independence of the involvement of the sweat glands in cystic
   fibrosis.  A case report of an infant girl, who died at age 9 years
   of progressive pulmonary disease, is presented.  The case indicates
   that fatal cystic fibrosis, or a variant thereof, can exist with
   normal levels of sweat chloride and that the pulmonary disease
   develops independently of the functional abnormality of the sweat
   glands.

AB The cardiac function of 21 patients with cystic fibrosis was studied
   using radionuclides and M-mode echocardiography. The patients (mean
   age 13.2 years, range 4 to 27) had a wide range of clinical and
   pulmonary function abnormalities (mean Shwachman-Kulczycki score
   62.1). Decreased right ventricular ejection fraction was found in 13
   of 18 patients (72%); an additional four patients had abnormal septal
   motion on ECHO. Left ventricular ejection fraction was abnormal at
   rest in four patients (19%); an additional four patients had
   borderline low LVEF. The LV pre-ejection period to ejection time
   ratio increased significantly (i.e., worsening LV performance) with
   deterioration of S-K score, chest radiograph score, and forced
   expiratory volume in 1 second. Three of eight patients with normal
   LVEF at rest had an abnormal response to supine bicycle exercise:
   LVEF fell in two patients and was unchanged in one. Thus evidence of
   LV dysfunction was observed in seven of 21 (33%) of the patients;
   four at rest and in three only during exercise.

EX We have been utilizing a patient's individual pharmacokinetic profile
   to plan and monitor aminoglycoside therapy, and we have often noted
   what appeared to be an extremely rapid elimination rate of gentamicin
   in our patients with cystic fibrosis.  The patients with cystic
   fibrosis had significantly greater renal and total clearances than
   those without cystic fibrosis.  If this observation could be extended
   to other drugs (such as the aminoglycosides), which are not normally
   subject to renal secretion, it would prove intriguing evidence for a
   possible primary renal defect in these patients.

AB The effects of oral administration of cephalexin were evaluated in a
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 17 patients
   with mild to moderate pulmonary disease due to cystic fibrosis.  For
   two years, four-month periods with cephalexin were alternated with
   four-month placebo periods.  Thus, patients served as their own
   control subjects.  Fungal vulvovaginitis occurred in two patients
   during cephalexin therapy.  During the 2 years of study, the rate of
   colonization with mucoid strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased
   and disease severity deteriorated in patients initially colonized
   with P. aeruginosa.  Short-term courses of sputum culture-specific
   antibiotics improved the course of some patients with mild to
   moderate pulmonary disease due to cystic fibrosis.  Treatment with
   cephalexin decreased the frequency of respiratory illnesses,
   respiratory illnesses requiring antibiotics, and hospitalizations
   for respiratory illnesses in patients initially colonized with
   Staphylococcus aureus and/or Haemophilus influenzae, and also
   reduced colonization with these organisms.  Improved weight gain in
   16 of 17 patients was associated with periods of cephalexin therapy.
   Pulmonary function tests remained stable or improved in 10 or 14
   patients.  Disease severity improved in patients not colonized with
   P. aeruginosa.

EX Mauriac syndrome is characterised by hepatomegaly, glycogen
   infiltration of the liver, retarded sexual maturation, and short
   stature in diabetic children.  We report the first example of Mauriac
   syndrome, in a patient clinically malnourished and edematous, who had
   a transient false positive sweat test.  Malnourished children who
   have a positive sweat test should have repeated sweat tests once the
   malnourished state has been reversed.  This would eliminate error in
   the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

AB Sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis are the most frequent lethal
   inherited diseases in the black and white population, respectively.
   The occurrence of both diseases in the same individual has not been
   reported in the literature.  This report presents two such patients
   and poses questions concerning the possible clinical implications of
   the simultaneous occurrence of both diseases.

AB Cystic fibrosis as a specific disease entity has been known to be
   associated with malnutrition for almost half a century. The
   importance of the malnutrition in the disease process remains
   unknown, as does much information about specific nutritional
   deficiencies in CF. Supplements for children with CF should include
   extra energy as fat or carbohydrate, a form of linoleic acid that can
   be absorbed, hydrolyzed protein, fat-soluble vitamins with vitamins A
   and E in a water emulsion, vitamin B12, probably B vitamins and
   vitamin C, and trace minerals. Routine measurements of nutritional
   status, particularly in children with growth failure, should be made
   at regular intervals and should include a three-day diet record and a
   simultaneous 72-hour stool fat determination. If fat malabsorption is
   not controlled by pancreatic enzymes, the use of antacids or
   cimetidine should be considered. The true role of nutrition in
   patients with CF will not be known until the appropriate studies are
   completed.

AB Patients with cystic fibrosis have fat malabsorption, providing an
   experimental model for evaluation of the hypothesis that a low-fat
   intake may prevent atherosclerosis. We studied the frequency and
   extent of aortic precursor lesions (fatty streaks, early
   fibromusculoelastic lesions, late fibromusculoelastic lesions) found
   at autopsy in this disease as well as in other patients with
   debilitating disorders but with no apparent impairment of fat
   absorption. Fatty streaks were less common in the cystic fibrosis
   group, as were the late fibromusculoelastic lesions. There was no
   significant difference in the frequency, length, or thickness of the
   early fibromusculoelastic lesions. The findings suggest that fat may
   be responsible for progression but not initiation of the
   fibromusculoelastic precursor lesions, and support the concept that
   early restriction of dietary fat may prevent, delay, or otherwise
   modify atherosclerosis in the adult.

EX We have also found a significant difference between the 6-hour
   urinary PABA recovery in healthy controls and CF patients, with no
   overlap of the ranges, and a good correlation with fecal chymotrypsin
   activity.  We can stress the usefulness of the test in this age
   group.  In studying a group of healthy newborn infants, however, the
   results were quite different: The PABA recovery was smaller and
   showed greater variations and overlap with results in CF patients
   occurred.  It is clear that the test is not applicable in newborn
   infants when performed in the described manner.  One possible
   explanation is the physiologically limited glomerular filtration rate
   in the newborn infant, which could have delayed the PABA excretion.

AB Brain abscess has only recently been considered a complication of
   cystic fibrosis. Three patients are reported here and a fourth cited
   from the literature. All of our patients were young adults with
   advanced pulmonary disease. The bacteria involved were mouth
   organisms and were found in the sputum culture in only one of the
   patients. Resistance was present to previously given antibiotics. As
   patients with cystic fibrosis survive into adulthood, the risk of
   developing a brain abscess appears to increase.

AB During the 14 yr from 1965 through 1978, 49 infants presented shortly
   after birth with intestinal obstruction due to impacted meconium.
   Three of these patients did not have fibrocystic disease. Eight
   patients were cured by a Gastrografin enema. There were 18 patients
   who had complications that included associated atresia, volvulus,
   and/or peritonitis. Various operations were done including resection
   with either primary anastomosis or enterostomy or varieties of the
   foregoing. Twenty-three babies had the simple uncomplicated form of
   meconium ileus. Eleven of these underwent resection and six patients
   died. Twelve patients were treated by laparotomy, ileotomy through a
   purse-string suture and prolonged irrigations using acetylcysteine.
   Of this group only one succumbed. This latter course of management is
   recommended for patients with simple uncomplicated meconium ileus as
   it involves no resection, no enterostomy, nor any primary
   anastomosis.

AB The total active transport of Cl ions across the frog's gastric
   mucosa can be considered as: net Cl- flux (serosa to mucosa) = H+ +
   SSC (short-circuit current), all terms expressed as micromole cm-2
   hr-1.  The net chloride flux (Hogben, 1955; Durbin & Heinz, 1958)
   may be divided into two fractions: an acidic one which is equivalent
   to the acid secreted and an electromotive one which accounts for the
   gastric electromotive force.  The changes in SCC can accordingly be
   used as a partial index to the activity of the chloride pump.
   Experiments were designed to investigate the effects of histamine,
   metiamide (H2 receptor antagonist), cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF
   plasma on the above parameters using the frog's isolated gastric
   mucosa.  The SCC and the resistance of the mucosal preparation is
   measured by means of an automatic SCC apparatus (de Jesus, 1977).
   The H ion secretion is measured by pH meter.  Results obtained
   (expressed as mean change (delta) plus or minus S.E. of mean) for
   histamine (10-4 M) (n = 10) show an initial increase of the SCC by
   36.94 plus or minus 2.95 microA cm-2 and a parallel small increase
   in H+ output by 0.045 plus or minus 0.003 micromole cm-2 hr-1.  This
   initial increase in SCC is followed by a drop to a steady-state
   level of 23.62 plus or minus 2.23 microA cm-2 and also by a large
   increase in H+ secretion 2.26 plus or minus 0.22 micromole cm-2
   hr-1.  These results support the work of Rehm (1961) in that
   histamine has an effect first on the Cl- pump and then on the H+
   secretion.  Metiamide (10-4 M) (n = 12) caused a drop in the SCC by
   20.16 plus or minus 2.32 microA cm-2 and also reduced the acid
   secretion by 2.21 plus or minus 0.14 micromole cm-2 hr-1, thus
   suggesting an effect on the Cl- pump as well as on the H+ secretion.
   Significant differences are shown (P < 0.001) between CF and non-CF
   plasma results.  The CF plasma (n = 8) increased the SCC by 17.25
   plus or minus 2.94 microA cm-2 and H+ secretion by 2.38 plus or
   minus 0.43 micromole cm-2 hr-1.  Non-CF plasma caused a slight
   increase in SCC by 5.17 plus or minus 1.1 microA cm-2 and had little
   effect on the H+ secretion, 0.34 plus or minus 0.01 micromole cm-2
   hr-1 (n = 8).  The effect of the CF plasma on the Cl- and H+
   mechanism is of interest since in cystic fibrosis there is an
   abnormal increase of Cl- and Na+ in the sweat of patients (di Sant
   Agnese, Darling, Perera & She, 1953).

AB Schulz (1969) showed that the raised Na concentration in the sweat
   of children suffering from cystic fibrosis  was due to a defect in
   Na reabsorption in the duct epithelium, but somewhat surprisingly
   the transepithelial potential difference (p.d.) is the same as that
   in normal controls.  Na transport is also reduced in the chronically
   ligated salivary duct of the rabbit submandibular gland (Fraser &
   Smaje, 1978), and because p.d. is unaffected, the ligated gland may
   be a useful model of this aspect of cystic fibrosis.  Here we would
   like to report a further similarity to cystic fibrosis; duct
   ligation leads to goblet cell hyperplasia which also occurs in the
   salivary glands in cystic fibrosis (Lev & Spicer, 1965).  Sections
   of the salivary duct 6 microm thick were taken at 60 microm
   intervals from ducts which had been ligated for between 1 and 5
   weeks and from their contralateral controls following fixation by
   immersion.  Ligation resulted in an increase in luminal diameter by
   distension of the previously convoluted epithelium, but there was no
   significant change in epithelial surface area.  The number of cell
   layers appeared to have increased however and there was a
   proliferation of goblet cells.  The mucus in these cells was stained
   by alcian blue at pH 1 indicating the presence of sulphomucin.  The
   mean goblet cell density rose from 7.62 plus or minus 4.73 mm-2
   (mean plus or minus S.E. of the mean, n = 6) in controls to 114 plus
   or minus 49.6 in ligated ducts.  The transepithelial Na flux in the
   same ducts was reduced from 10.1 plus or minus 0.79 n-mole cm-2
   sec-1 to 1.6 plus or minus 0.84 while p.d. remained at -22 mV,
   similar to those results previously reported.  There was no
   significant correlation between the degree of diminution of Na
   transport and the density of goblet cells but there was a positive
   correlation (r = 0.90) between the number of goblet cells in the
   control and contralateral ligated ducts.

EX I agree that sweat tests are frequently not performed reliably, but I
   wonder why the clinical chemist has been singled out as being
   responsible when most hospital laboratories are still directed by
   pathologists and not by professional clinical chemists.  In addition
   to our laboratory, I know of many other hospital clinical chemistry
   laboratories in which the test is being performed properly.
   Furthermore, the Pediatric Committee of the American Association for
   Clinical Chemistry is working on a review article for the journal,
   Clinical Chemistry, regarding the correct way the sweat test should
   be run.  Clearly, clinical chemists do not "lack interest."

EX The major issue is not the "lack of interest of clinical chemists,"
   but the actual performance of the test.  Neither the pathologist nor
   the clinical chemist, in all likelihood, actually performs the test.
   Rather, it is the medical technologist or technician who carries out
   the actual procedure.  It is a major part of our roles as educators
   and laboratory administrators to ensure that these people are
   adequately trained for the task and that the test meets high enough
   performance standards to provide a clinically relevant answer.

AB Immunoreactive serum trypsin was measured with a double antibody
   radioimmunoassay in normal subjects and patients with various
   diseases of the pancreas. The normal range is 115-350 ng/ml with a
   geometric mean of 212 ng/ml. No trypsin was found in serum after
   total duodenopancreatectomy, in about 75% of patients with cystic
   fibrosis and in a few patients with pancreas carcinoma or chronic
   pancreatitis. Reduced serum trypsin levels between 10 and 100 ng/ml
   were measured in the remaining 25% of cystic fibrosis and in one
   third of the patients with chronic pancreatitis. Serum trypsin was
   increased to 700-17,000 ng/ml in all patients with acute pancreatitis
   or during the acute phase of chronic pancreatitis. Absent or reduced
   serum trypsin is a reliable indicator of total or partial exocrine
   pancreatic insufficiency whereas considerably increased serum trypsin
   concentration do indicate acute pancreatitis.

AB Nineteen nasal polyps from 13 patients were examined histologically.
   Nine polyps from seven cystic fibrosis (CF) patients could be
   positively identified by a triad of observations: delicate, barely
   visible basement membrane of surface epithelium without submucosal
   hyalinization, lack of extensive infiltration of eosinophils (Giemsa
   stains), and a preponderance of acid mucin in glands and cysts of the
   polyp and in its surface mucous blanket (Alcian Blue-periodic acid-
   Schiff stains). Two polyps from two patients with CF and atopy showed
   the characteristic findings of CF without modification. Eight polyps
   from four atopic patients without CF were identified by the reverse
   triad of changes: extensive thickening of the epithelial basement
   membrane and its extension into the submucosa as an irregular hyaline
   membrane, high stromal eosinophil count, and mainly neutral mucin in
   mucous glands, cysts, and mucous blanket. Hyperplastic mucous glands,
   mucous cysts of variable sizes, focal metaplasia of surface
   epithelium, and acid mucin in goblet cells were considered
   nonspecific lesions.

AB An immunoreactive-trypsin assay uses small dried-blood spots
   (diameter 1.25 mm) and is therefore suitable for incorporation in
   established neonatal screening schemes. Blood specimens from neonates
   with cystic fibrosis had trypsin levels greater than those in control
   subjects, thus confirming earlier findings. Trypsin levels were below
   normal in several older patients with cystic fibrosis.

EX Dr Hosli and Mrs Hosli reported that differential thermolability of
   plasma alpha-mannosidase and plasma acid phosphatase allowed
   discrimination between normal people, cystic fibrosis carriers, and
   patients.  We have repeated these experiments, paying special
   attention to the technical details given in the Hoslis's paper.  In a
   separate series of experiments we used larger volumes of plasma for
   each assay, which was performed either with or without
   non-fluorescent paraffin oil.  In both cases the blood samples were
   processed exactly as outlined in Hosli and Vogt's paper.  There were
   no significant differences in the heat stability of plasma
   alpha-mannosidase and acid phosphatase between the three groups.

EX We have measured immunoreactive trypsin IRT activity in dried blood
   spot samples and have found abnormally high levels in infants with
   cystic fibrosis (CF).  We agree with Crossley et al. that this test
   deserves further investigation as a screen for CF in the newborn.
   The low value for the 94 week infant is consistent with their finding
   that, in children with low pancreatic enzyme output, the increased
   IRT results are restricted to the first few months of life.  It
   remains to be proved whether older CF patients with residual
   pancreatic enzyme secretion do indeed continue to have increased IRT
   levels.  If they do, the IRT test would also deserve further
   investigation as a tool, to be used in conjunction with stool
   pancreatic enzyme activity, in smaller centres who have had problems
   with inaccurate sweat tests.

EX We examined the age dependence of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme
   (SACE) activity in healthy controls.  While we found no age
   dependence in controls older than 20 years, those under 20 had much
   increased SACE values.  We feel that it is inappropriate to evaluate
   SACE activity in patients under 20 years old with diagnostic criteria
   determined in adults. - Dr Romer and colleagues reported high
   activities of SACE in 3 patients out of 10 with chronic granulomatous
   disease (CGD) and concluded that "CGD is associated with increased
   levels of SACE".  Unfortunately, Romer et al. did not study an
   adequate paedeatric age control group, and their mean values are
   compared primarily with that in 5 children with cystic fibrosis.  Our
   most recent studies confirm our earlier observation that children
   under the age 19 years definitely have higher mean SACE values than
   do adults.  Cystic-fibrosis patients should not be used for
   comparison since they tend to have lower SACE levels than comparable
   aged controls.  In my opinion patients with CGD, according to the
   data published by Romer et al., show no increase in SACE levels for
   their age.

MN CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: en.  FEMALE.  HUMAN.  HYMECROMONE.  PREGNANCY.
EX For several reasons the supernatant fraction of amniotic fluid is not
   often used in the prenatal detection of inborn errors of metabolism.
   In early pregnancy the bulk of the protein in amniotic fluid is
   derived from the maternal circulation, and this can obscure the more
   critical contribution from the fetus needed for prenatal diagnosis.
   10 - 30% of amniotic fluids are significantly contaminated with
   maternal blood, and if the enzyme in question is present in this
   blood (as 4-methylumbelliferyl guanidinobenzoate [MUGB] protease is),
   this can further distort diagnostic conclusions.  For this reason we
   have examined the variation of MUGB protease in a heterogenous
   collection of amniotic fluids.  No significant differences in titre
   between individual weeks in the second trimester were observed.  A
   further 104 second-trimester amniotic fluids from pregnancies with
   abnormal outcome were also investigated.  The means of the four
   groups were not significantly different from that of the normals and
   the ranges were very similar.  We have not yet had the opportunity to
   examine an amniotic fluid from a known case of cystic fibrosis.
   Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis could probably be further refined by
   coupling amniotic-fluid protease titration and isoelectric focusing
   on polyacrylamide gel.

EX Our cystic-fibrosis  children usually either have severe lung disease
   with mild steatorrhea or severe maldigestion with lesser pulmonary
   problems.  We therefore measured serum-proteases in cystic-fibrosis
   patients and controls to see if there was any support for the
   following hypothesis: since lack of antitrypsin is associated with
   lung damage, plasma-trypsin in excess of antitrypsin might be
   responsible for the lung damage in cystic fibrosis.  General protease
   and trypsin levels were measured spectrophotometrically using a
   modification of the method of Erlanger, Kojowsky and Cohen.  Our
   result showed no significant difference between protease and trypsin
   levels in cystic-fibrosis patients and controls.  The difference
   between our results and those of Crossley et al. may be explained by
   the differing measuring technique used.  Our trypsin levels were
   measured spectrophotometrically and theirs by radioimmunoassay.

EX We have studied serum-angiotensin-converting-enzyme (SACE) in
   sarcoidosis and other granulomatous disorders.  We have measured SACE
   in 10 randomly chosen, consecutive patients with chronic
   granulomatous disease (CGD) and in some of their family members and
   in 5 children with cystic fibrosis and severe chronic pulmonary
   involvement.  SACE levels in the patient with CGD differed
   significantly from those of normal controls and those of family
   members and patients with cystic fibrosis.  Our preliminary studies
   show that CGD is associated with increased levels of SACE.

   cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and a variety of controls. In the first few
   months of life all C.F. children had a raised serum-I.R.T. A dried

EX A little-known feature of cystic fibrosis is the frequent occurrence
   of positive skin-prick tests to environmental allergies.  In the
   normal population only about half those with positive prick tests
   actually have clinical allergic disease; so, are the positive
   skin-tests of cystic fibrosis clinically important?  In particular,
   do they mean a high prevalence of asthma, overt or hidden, amongst
   these patients?  A general clinical impression is that asthma is no
   more frequent amongst cystic fibrosis than in the normal population.
   The often positive skin tests, although of considerable immunological
   interest, do not necessarily imply additional clinical disease.

EX We measured immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) concentrations in 32
   patients with established cystic fibrosis and in 16 parents
   (heterozygotes) of patients with CF.  29 patients (91%) and 6 parents
   (38%) had abnormal trypsin concentrations.  We found that in only 3
   out of the 29 patients with abnormal IRT was the concentration
   supranormal.  Our data suggest that low IRT concentrations are an
   excellent index of diminished pancreatic reserve in CF and that
   serum-IRT concentration would be a useful diagnostic test.  The fact
   that CF patients at birth invariably have very high IRT
   concentrations which fall with age and the progress of the disease,
   allied with the fact that heterozygotes have high concentrations,
   supports the previous suggestion that an uncontrolled hypersecretion
   of zymogen granules is the basic cellular defect in CF.

   PREGNANCY.
EX Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated significant
   differences in the extent of protease reactivity with MUGB
   (4-methylumbelliferyl guanidinobenzoate, a sensitive active site
   titrant of many serine proteases) when plasma and cultivated skin
   fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), obligate
   heterozygotes, and controls were compared.  Because of these
   observations, and the potential value of amniotic fluid for the
   prenatal detection of cystic fibrosis, these studies were extended to
   human amniotic fluid obtained by amniocentesis done for the
   intrauterine detection of genetic and other fetal abnormalities.  An
   amniotic-fluid sample obtained from a woman who was subsequently
   delivered of a baby with CF showed a much reduced level of MUGB
   reactivity similar to the relative deficiency observed in plasma and
   cultivated skin fibroblasts from patients with CF.  These
   observations suggest that amniotic-fluid protease activity may be a
   useful marker for the prenatal detection of CF.

EX Despite some critical debate lately about the usefulness of
   physiotherapy in certain chest conditions, the fact remains that many
   patients voluntarily undertake regular postural bronchial drainage to
   help their sputum.  A substantial number also find rapid chest
   percussion over affected lung segments useful in loosening the
   sputum.  Chest percussion by a mechanical device controlled by the
   patient himself seems worthy to trial.  Maxwell and Redmond have
   compared a commercial device with manual percussion during postural
   bronchial drainage.  The two techniques resulted in expectoration of
   similar quantities of sputum, although all but one patient felt
   subjectively that the machine delivered better-quality percussion.
   Before parents and others are advised to buy percussing machines, we
   need a formal study of postural drainage with and without chest
   percussion.

EX Dr Hosli and Esther Vogt base their diagnosis of heterozygotes and
   homozygotes for cystic fibrosis on the thermal stability in plasma or
   extracellular fluids of alpha-mannosidase and/or phosphatase activity
   assayed at pH 5.4.  The activity of alpha-mannosidase in plasma and
   this pH is a composite one: both acidic alpha-mannosidase, which has
   a pH optimum of 4.25 and intermediate alpha-mannosidase, which has a
   pH optimum of 5.6 - 6.0, will contribute to the activity measured at
   pH 5.4.  These two forms of alpha-mannosidase are structurally and
   genetically distinct and have different kinetics and
   thermostabilities.  Therefore the total alpha-mannosidase activity at
   pH 5.4 and the physicochemical properties of this activity will
   depend upon the relative proportions of the two types of
   alpha-mannosidase in the sample.  The proportions of the two forms
   vary widely in normal plasma, especially in plasma from children.
   Although the data of Hosli and Vogt suggest that the total
   alpha-mannosidase at pH 5.4 does not differ significantly between
   controls, CF heterozygotes and CF homozygotes, they do not show
   whether the proportions of acidic and intermediate alpha-mannosidase
   have changed.  An increase in the proportion of the thermolabile
   intermediate alpha-mannosidase in CF would be manifested as a
   decreased thermostability of alpha-mannosidase at pH 5.4.
   Alternatively a mutation in the normally stable acidic
   alpha-mannosidase leading to a less stable form would also be
   reflected as a decreased stability in the activity at pH 5.4,
   especially if the proportion of acidic alpha-mannosidase was
   increased in CF.  These situations should also be considered as
   possible explanations of the observations, in addition to the one
   favoured by Hosli and Vogt.

EX Following Rao and Nadlers' report of decrease arginine activity in
   the blood of patients with cystic fibrosis we have been trying to
   apply their findings to the prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
   We were therefore most interested in the reports on the use of
   4-methylumbelliferyl-rho-guanidinobenzoate (MUGB) for assaying
   arginine esterase activity in amniotic fluid.  Our results with MUGB
   are similar to those of Brock and Haywood but are substantially
   higher than those of Walsh and Nedler.  A sample of amniotic fluid
   that had been incubated with MUGB and then assayed with
   pro-phe-arg-4-methylcoumarinyl-7-amide (PPA-MCA) showed less than 20%
   of the activity of a similarly treated control sample that had not
   been incubated with MUGB.  The activity of arginine esterase towards
   PPA-MCA both in amniotic fluid and in cultures amniotic fluid cells
   is much greater than towards CBZ-Arg-AMC.  These levels of activity
   are high enough to warrant further investigation for use in an
   antenatal diagnosis.

AB Evidence is accumulating which indicates that the basic defect in
   cystic fibrosis interferes with the formation of recognition markers
   on hydrolytic enzymes. As a result these hydrolases leak into the
   extracellular space and some of them display abnormal
   thermolabilities. By heat inactivation of plasma alpha-mannosidase at
   41 degrees C and plasma phosphatase at 36.5 degrees C, both enzymes
   being assayed at pH 5.4, it is possible to differentiate normal
   people from cystic fibrosis carriers and patients.

AB Since it has been demonstrated that chronic administration of
   reserpine to rats produces CF-like alterations, we have studied the
   lung resistance to bacterial infections in animals treated with
   reserpine.  Mice of the BALB/c inbred strain were injected
   subcutaneously with different doses of reserpine for 7 days; after,
   they were submitted to an infective aerosol containing
   Staphylococcus aureus in a nebulization chamber.  With each pair of
   exposed animals, an individual value of the uncleared bacteria ratio
   (UBR) at 4 hours was obtained.  Reserpinized animals showed a
   significant increase in UBR values when compared to control mice (p
   < 0.05 and p < 0.01 depending on the doses), suggesting an
   impairment of the lung antibacterial defenses.  Although
   pharmacological doses of reserpine produce catecholamine depletion,
   we can not conclude that this action upon the nervous system is the
   only cause of the CF-like response we detected.  In conclusion, the
   observed UBR decrease lends support to the concept of a reserpine-
   induced CF animal model.

AB Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal or semi-lethal genetic
   disease in Caucasians of Central European origin, among whom it is
   inherited as an autosomal recessive trait at a frequency
   approximately 10 times that expected from recurrent mutation alone. A
   decreased sialic acid content has been observed in cell surface
   glycoproteins on cystic fibrosis fibroblasts and in numerous soluble
   glycoprotein preparations from cystic fibrosis homozygotes. Sialic
   acid residues on cell surface glycoconjugates play an essential role
   in the binding and infectivity of myxoviruses and paramyxoviruses,
   including those causing pandemic influenza. It is suggested that
   increased resistance to these viruses conferred by similar but
   quantitatively smaller alterations in sialoglycoconjugate structure
   in cystic fibrosis heterozygotes may have provided a selective
   advantage to maintain the high frequency of the cystic fibrosis gene
   in Caucasian populations.

AB As the pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis (CF) has been considered to
   lie in a disturbance in the behavior of secretions, particularly
   mucins, from exocrine glands, it has been proposed that an alteration
   in surface topography (form, number or distribution of microvilli or
   blebs) of epithelial cells lining ducts could impair distribution
   leading to retention of mucus leading to the clinical phenotype.
   Scanning electronmicroscopy of human epithelial suspension cultures
   now offers an opportunity to evaluate the role of plasmalemma
   topography in CF.

EX Lysosomal acid hydrolases and alkaline phosphatase cooperate in the
   intracellular digestion of natural polymers.  A stimulus for the
   induction of these enzymes is the retention of any kind of polymer
   inside the cell.  This stimulus is long-lasting and strong if
   polymers are intracellularly retained because of a lack of digestive
   enzymes.  In previous papers it has been demonstrated that the
   alkaline phosphatase (AIP) induction with Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein
   discriminates between fibroblasts of CF homozygotes on the one hand
   and normals and CF carriers on the other hand, and a hypothesis has
   been proposed to explain these observations.  As predicted, more
   efficient inducing mixtures have since been developed; these have
   been used in the present study.  The first writer familiarized
   himself with ultramicrotechniques and then carried out double blind
   studies on 20 fibroblast cultures from French patients.  These
   findings demonstrate the reproducibility of the AIP induction and of
   the methods used, and they particularly underline the importance of
   employing the present ultramicrotechniques for a successful AIP
   induction.  It is likely that amniotic fluid cells behave like skin
   fibroblasts in this test; if this proves to be so, then the induction
   of alkaline phosphatase should provide a useful technique for the
   prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

   cystic fibrosis and managed by the Departments of Thoracic Medicine
   and Gastroenterology, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, is
   reviewed. Eighty per cent of patients survived to 11 years of age,
   and 64% to 18 years. Of patients managed between 1973 and 1977, 91%
   survived to 12 years of age, and 80% to 17 years of age. In the same
   period, 79% of patients survived for 16 years after diagnosis. Forty-
   four per cent of the 240 patients currently being managed have no
   significant permanent lung disease, and only 9% have advanced
   disease.

EX Hosli has published a hypothesis relating to the primary cause of
   cystic fibrosis (CF) based on his observations that the level of
   alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in CF-derived skin fibroblasts, but not
   fibroblasts derived from normal individuals, could be increased
   several-fold by growing the cells in the presence of the urinary
   glycoprotein, Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP).  However, we have not been
   able to show, in Adelaide, any change or induction in the level of
   ALP activity in CF-derived skin fibroblasts when grown in the
   presence of locally prepared THP under what appear to be identical
   cell culture conditions to those used by Hosli.  It thus appears that
   under the conditions currently employed in our laboratory, there is
   no diagnostic discrimination between fibroblasts of CF homozygotes
   and normal individuals.

AB Chest physiotherapy is an important part of the treatment program of
   children with cystic fibrosis, but controlled studies of its effects
   are few.  27 children with cystic fibrosis, 20 being chronic sputum
   producers and 7 non-sputum producers, were studied in hospital with
   serial lung function tests on 3 consecutive days.  On the 1st day
   physiotherapy was performed twice; on the 2nd day no physiotherapy
   was performed; on the 3rd day the two periods of physiotherapy were
   preceded by an inhaled bronchodilator (Rimiterol).  Lung function
   tests included peak flow, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced
   expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1.0) and residual volume to total
   lung capacity ratio, and were measured at the beginning of each day
   and at similar intervals throughout the 3 days.  Sputum volume and
   cough frequency were noted on day 1 and day 3.  Physiotherapy
   resulted in significant improvement of peak flow in the sputum
   producers.  However, the FVC and FEV1.0, while improving after
   physiotherapy, also improved on the control day when no
   physiotherapy was performed.  This suggests that physiotherapy may
   be effective in removing sputum from central large airways with
   resultant improvement in peak flow, but has little added effect on
   the more peripheral airways, whose airflow improves through the day
   with normal activity.  No significant effect was shown in the non-
   sputum producers although there was a trend towards improvement in
   peak flow.  A bronchodilator before physiotherapy may be beneficial
   in those patients who demonstrate significant reduction in airflow
   obstruction at formal testing of bronchodilator response, but may
   lessen the beneficial effects of physiotherapy in those without a
   positive response.  The study illustrates the importance of
   examining difference methods of chest physiotherapy, to find ways of
   improving sputum clearance.

AB In 17 children (group A) with cystic fibrosis (CF) the effect of the
   following treatment schedules on pulmonary function has been studied in
   random order on 4 consecutive days: (1) clapping and postural drainage
(CP);
   (2) CP after inhaling an aerosol of 5 ml 20% N-acetylcysteine by a Monaghan
   ultrasonic device; (3) as in 2 but with the addition of 0.5 mg isoprenaline
   to the aerosol; (4) as in 3 but with an IPPB device added to the nebulizer.
   Treatment was started at 9.30 a.m. and lasted for about 1 h.  Pulmonary
   function was measured prior to and 30 min after treatment (9.00 and 11.00
   a.m., respectively).  In 8 children (group B) with CF (severity comparable
   to the previous group) pulmonary function was measured at 9.00 and 11.00
a.m.
   but without physiotherapy in between.  The following pulmonary function
   measurements have been included in the evaluation of the results: VC, FVC,
   FEV1, TLC (body box), TLC (helium dilution), TLCBb-TLCHe, RVBb, RVHe,
maximal
   expiratory flows at 60% TLBBb, 25% FVC, maximal midexpiratory flow, airway
   conductance.  The technique of the determinations was carefully controlled
   and initial values were reproducible in most children.  In group B, mean
   values of pulmonary function were equal at 9.00 and 11.00 a.m.  In group
A
   none of the treatment schedules caused a significant improvement of mean
   pulmonary function values.  In some of the children, however, pulmonary
   function improved, but in others it deteriorated. The significance of these
   findings was discussed.

EX We explored 44 children suffering from cystic fibrosis with
   predominant pulmonary involvement and followed in particular the
   course of illness of 30 of these patients during an average period of
   4 years.  We were impressed by the enormous variability of the
   pulmonary symptomatology in these children.  The question arose
   whether this clinical impression is supported by the finding of the
   thorax radiograph and the results of the lung functions tests and the
   blood gas measures at rest and on exercise.  From the clinical point
   of view, there is a possibility to make a classification of severity
   in pulmonary aspects of this disease.  Because of the large ranges of
   the score values a clear distinction of the severity could only be
   possible if large groups of patients were to be compared.  For the
   interindividual comparison the cumulative evaluation of a clinical
   score, the chest radiograph and the lung function tests are
   indispensable.  Only the continuous follow-up of these examinations
   allows one to notice, in time, a progressive lung involvement with
   its degenerative changes.

EX This paper is a report on the first part of a comprehensive research
   programme.  The aim is the development of a mechanical aid which will
   enable patients with cystic fibrosis to give themselves satisfactory
   physiotherapy.  The percussor, which can be used by patients, parents
   or relatives, is portable and lightweight.  The domiciliary trial
   showed that effective percussion could be self-administered to the
   front of the chest and to a lesser extent to the sides of the chest.
   The percussor was found to be very acceptable to adolescent patients
   and especially girls with early breast development.  Further research
   work has now been completed and as a result a system has been
   developed which enables patients to treat themselves with
   satisfactory chest percussion in the five preferred positions of
   postural drainage.

EX In 1977, we demonstrated the efficiency of autogenic drainage with
   two bronchorrheic children, who needed bronchography for diagnostic
   purposes.  This demonstration was made possible thanks to a
   radiocinematographic study after bronchography.  The examination also
   showed the inefficacy of coughing.  The object of the present study
   is to analyze the physiologic mechanism of autogenic drainage.  For
   children older than five, this method is very simple and efficient
   and as the effort or onset is not excessive and as expiration does
   not need to be complete, autogenic drainage is not exhausting and can
   be performed for a long time, which is indispensable since the
   progression of secretions is slow.

EX The problem of proper diet to children and infants with cystic
   fibrosis is continuously discussed.  This paper deals with the diet
   for CF infants younger than one year.  The basic view is that the
   diet should be as close to the 'normal baby' diet as possible, partly
   to ensure normal growth and development, and partly to avoid extra
   work for the families with CF infants.  Infants suffering from CF
   were given lactose-free diet until they reached the age of one year.
   The weight increased more rapidly than in CF patients given the
   traditional CF diet with low fat and high protein.  Furthermore, it
   was not necessary to give increased amounts of calories to the
   infants given lactose-free diet, nor did they receive additional
   fat-soluble vitamins.

EX This review emphasizes some of the positive accomplishments of cystic
   fibrosis research, some of the puzzles and some of the recent
   developments that have promise.  One of the major unresolved
   questions is the maintenance of this lethal gene at such a high
   frequency, perhaps because of a heterozygote advantage in the past,
   no longer operative at present.  Nothing is known of the chromosomal
   localization of the trait; except that chromosomes are
   morphologically normal, that it is autosomal, not sex linked and that
   there is no correlation with blood groups or major HLA loci.  One of
   the important achievements of the past many years is that we
   understand relatively well the pathogenesis of most clinical
   manifestations of CF.  The as yet unknown inherited basic defect or
   metabolic error of CF gives rise to two main anomalies: the
   electrolyte defect in exocrine sweat glands and the 'mucous
   secretion' abnormality.  While the results of tissue culture studies
   often have been conflicting and disparate, it does seem to be the
   consensus that the fibroblasts are affected by the basic metabolic
   error in some manner, and that they respond abnormally under
   different experimental circumstances.  Virtually all investigators
   have found some anomalies in biologic fluids of CF, although using
   different approaches and methods.  An abnormality in the function of
   the autonomic nervous system, which is so closely associated with the
   exocrine glands, has always been an attractive explanation for the
   generalized exocrinopathy of CF.  The search for a genetic animal
   model for CF has led to interesting findings.

EX Water, electrolyte and macromolecular secretion, which is affected in
   cystic fibrosis, is regulated by neurotransmitters of the autonomic
   nervous system stimulating the cells by binding to alpha-adrenergic,
   beta-adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.  Therefore, a genetic
   disturbance in cyclic 3'5'-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP) response
   could eventually explain some of the manifold expressions of labile
   biochemical changes observed in CF, specially in tissue culture.  We
   further characterized beta-receptors in cultured fibroblasts of CF
   patients and normal controls and investigated isoproterenol and
   prostaglandin E1-mediated c-AMP response using defined culture
   conditions.  No significant difference was found between the two
   phenotypes on basal c-AMP values.  With the exception of one cell
   line, CF strains had 25 to 180% increased c-AMP content.  This
   difference is highly significant (p < 0.0025).  This statistically
   significant difference in response can neither be attributed to
   differences in dose- or time-response curves nor to differential
   c-AMP escape into culture medium.  Since CF cells synthesize more
   c-AMP than controls only in response to isoproterenol but not to
   prostaglandin E1, the alteration which might be responsible for the
   observed phenomenon is probably located proximal of the adenylate
   cyclase at the cells border between intra- and extracellular space.

EX This paper presents preliminary results from metabolic balance
   studies of iron, zinc and manganese absorption and retention in
   children with cystic fibrosis and Shwachman's syndrome.
   Malabsorption of zinc, iron and manganese in exocrine pancreatic
   insufficiency has been demonstrated by these early studies.  A
   possible relationship between this and the associated features of CF
   has been briefly discussed, and indicates areas for further research.
   If such relationships are established then some form of trace element
   supplementation should be considered.

EX Recently, one of us suggested a new hypothesis concerning the 'basic
   defect' of cystic fibrosis.  The purpose of the present paper is to
   review this model and to critically discuss its eventual diagnostic
   applications.  With extensive studies, we collected experimental data
   which contribute five major arguments in favour of the proposition
   that CF may be an enzyme recognition site mutant.  With fibroblast
   cultures the three genotypes can be separated in the following way:
   CF homozygote, leaky for alkaline phosphatase (A1P) and lysosomal
   hydrolases/A1P is Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP) inducible; CF
   heterozygote, leaky for A1P and lysosomal hydrolases/A1P is not THP
   inducible; normal control, not leaky for A1P and lysosomal
   enzymes/A1P is not THP inducible.  With the exception of a second
   double-blind study, the THP induction as well as the leakage analysis
   seem to be statistically unequivocal: they strongly support our
   hypothesis concerning the basic defect in CF.

EX In recent years, several workers have reported that a single 2-hour
   postprandial total serum bile acid (TSBA) concentration, in a variety
   of liver disease states, is a more sensitive index of deranged liver
   function than are the 'conventional' serum liver function tests.
   This observation seemed to us to provide a challenging situation for
   the assessment of TSBA concentrations in cystic fibrosis.  The
   distribution of results for the CF patients (mean TSBA concentration
   27.0 micromol/l) and for the age-matched controls (mean concentration
   19.9 micromol/l) shows a wider range for the CF group.  Statistical
   analysis, however, of these two groups shows no significant
   difference between them.  Many factors affect both the size and
   distribution of the bile acid pool in CF, and a consideration of
   these factors may go some way towards explaining the rather
   unspectacular TSBA results.

EX We decided to survey a geographically defined population of cystic
   fibrosis patients and parents living in Avon County, England.  By
   examining the obligate heterozygotes (the parents), we would be able
   to assess the influence of the CF gene without the presence of the
   disease.  There is an increase in immediate hypersensitivity to A.
   fumigatus in CF patients but not their parents.  This increased
   sensitivity is probably IgE-mediated and a secondary effect of lung
   damage.  There is no evidence that the CF gene produces a generalised
   increase in skin reactivity (atopy), serum IgE or serum IgG4 in the
   heterozygotes.  They are not therefore likely to develop asthma.

EX In our efforts to standardize the evaluation of bronchial reactivity
   we performed investigations into the threshold dosage of
   acetylcholine-induced bronchospasm in patients with various recurrent
   and chronic bronchopulmonary diseases.  A significantly decreased
   threshold value of acetylcholine and thus an increased bronchial
   reactivity could be proven in patients with cystic fibrosis in
   comparison with healthy children.  The cause of bronchial
   hyperreactivity in patients with CF may be due to proteases deriving
   from leucocytes of the purulent sputum.  Furthermore, we investigated
   the influence of terbutaline on the bronchial obstruction induced by
   acetylcholine in patients with bronchial asthma and cystic fibrosis.
   The groups were comparable, especially with regard to the degree of
   the initial bronchial obstruction.

EX The aim of the present study is to reassess the peripheral pattern of
   thyroid function in subjects with cystic fibrosis with special
   reference to their responsiveness to thyrotropin-releasing hormone
   (TRH) stimulation.  In all the CF patients the basal levels of serum
   T4, T3, and TBG were within the normal range.  Mean values in CF
   patients and in control children were not significantly different.
   In CF patients there is no correlation between the TSH response area
   and the basal level of serum T4, or with grading according to
   Shwachman and Kulczycki.  We found no relation with therapy.  In
   basal conditions, our data show a completely normal pattern of the
   serum concentration of T4, T3, TBG and TSH in subjects with CF in
   absence of iodide therapy.  Thyroid status should be examined in
   patients with CF specially when they receive iodide therapy or other
   drugs which can enhance the impairment of thyroid function.

EX An alternative method for assaying the cystic fibrosis factor could
   be on the electrophysiological responses of isolated living tissues.
   The ability of the frog's gastric mucosa to secrete hydrochloric acid
   and maintain a negative potential difference is well known.  This
   potential difference across the secretory (mucosa) to the nutrient
   (serosa) side coupled with its property of transporting chloride and
   hydrogen ions against an electrochemical gradient could therefore
   serve as a useful model for investigating any induced changes in the
   presence of CF and non-CF plasma.  From the results obtained the
   short circuit current and H+ secretion responses in the presence of
   CF (whole) plasma show significant increases compared to the control.
   These findings show that in the presence of CF plasma, whole or
   plasma fraction B, there is a marked increase in the actively
   transported Cl- and H+.  The effect of CF plasma in increasing net
   Cl- flux is important considering the elevation of this electrolyte
   in the sweat of CF patients and deserved further investigation.

EX Elliott's works, together with the previous works of several authors
   reporting low essential fatty acid concentrations in the serum lipids

   treating older CF patients with Intralipid for 1 year.  We found no
   side effects in treating older CF patients with Intralipid for 1
   year.  On the other hand the objective benefit was very limited and
   today confusing, i.e., only a slight but significant improvement in
   the renal sodium excretion after an oral sodium load was found.  The

EX Patients with cystic fibrosis have a higher incidence of positive
   skin prick tests than normal; this may be the result of defective
   antigen handling at mucosal surfaces.  Our aim was to investigate
   bronchial allergy in a group of children with CF and positive skin
   tests.  We studied 15 children aged 7 to 16 years with mild to
   moderate respiratory disease.  Only 1 child gave a history of
   wheezing not associated with chest infections and this study supports
   the hypothesis that clinical asthma is a product of bronchial allergy
   and broncholability.  The responses to bronchial provocation with
   Aspergillus suggest that allergy to this antigen may play a part in
   the pathogenesis of lung disease in some patients with CF.

EX We focused our study on concentration of immunoglobulins, lysozyme,
   lactoferrin, some antiproteolytic fractions and acute phase proteins
   in bronchial secretion of children with various pulmonary diseases,
   especially with cystic fibrosis.  Secretory IgA is decreased in all
   studied groups of patients having chronic or recurrent infections of
   the respiratory tract (when compared to the group of healthy
   children).  Groups which were characterized by the infection of the
   lower part of the respiratory tract had increased lysozyme level.
   The results obtained in the group of CF children are similar to those
   obtained in groups with bronchiectasis and chronic bronchitis, which
   suggests that the observed differences are characteristic for chronic
   infection rather than for CF.  Although in CF as well as in
   bronchiectasis massive bacterial infection results in increased
   concentration of immunoglobulins, antiproteolytic fractions and acute
   phase proteins, the results seen in both groups are somewhat
   different.  These differences may indicate some difference in the
   reactivity to infection of the respiratory tract in CF in comparison
   to patients with bronchiectasis.  It seems conceivable that among
   children with CF who have very low S-IgA, chronic respiratory tract
   infections occur earlier and IgG response to permanent exposition to
   variety of antigens is less vigorous.  The presented results raise
   also a possibility that the bacterial infection in CF does not
   stimulate defence mechanisms to the same extent as in bronchiectasis.

EX This study examined whether biologic activation of C3 with subsequent
   pulmonary inflammation takes place in the lungs of patients with
   cystic fibrosis.  Plasma complement C3 levels were all normal.
   Eleven of the patients with the C3 split product C3c were from the
   group of 14 patients suffering from chronic infection with mucoid
   strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 2 were from the group of 14 CF
   patients without P. aeruginosa infection.  This difference was
   significant (p < 0.002).  A comparison of albumin ratios between the
   13 patients with the C3 split product C3c and the remaining other 15
   patients showed a significant higher ratio in the former group (p <
   0.01) on an average 4.1 versus 1.4 per cent.  The significantly
   higher albumin ratio demonstrated in the patients with C3c in their
   sputum sol phase supports the concept of complement-induced
   inflammation with subsequent transudation of plasma proteins in these
   patients.  This study thus shows that complement-mediated
   inflammatory reactions may play an important role in the pathogenesis
   of pulmonary tissue damage in patients with CF, even when the plasma
   C3 levels are normal, and it supports the concept of chronic P.
   aeruginosa lung infection as an immune complex disease in CF
   patients.

EX To study the parotid gland function in children with cystic fibrosis
   we investigated parotid saliva specimens of 18 such patients.  We
   compared the results with a control group of 12 healthy children of
   the same age and sex.  Furthermore, children with bronchial asthma
   and chronic bronchitis were examined.  The flow rate of the parotid
   and the protein output without stimulation were nearly the same for
   the four groups.  In patients with CF the protein output after
   stimulation was significantly lower.  An increased level of sodium
   was observed in the stimulated secretion and the unstimulated saliva
   as well.  In CF children we found a significant higher output of
   sodium in both stimulated parotid saliva and unstimulated parotid
   saliva.  The IgG output of the gland after stimulation was found to
   be slightly reduced in patients with CF in comparison to healthy
   children.  The output of the gland for IgA after stimulation was
   observed to be strongly reduced for the group with CF and for the
   group with bronchial asthma.  The decreased output of the gland for
   secretory IgA after stimulation was demonstrated again in CF and in
   bronchial asthma in comparison with healthy persons.  The increased
   sodium concentration in parotid saliva may be caused in a similar way
   as the electrolyte abnormality of sweat in CF patients, namely by a
   decreased net reabsorption of sodium.  Due to the result of an
   increased electrolyte output and decreased immunoglobulin output of
   parotid gland we can suppose that the molecular magnitude plays its
   role in this disturbance.

EX Wallwork and co-workers have proposed that increased absorption of
   antigens takes place across the mucosal membranes of the gut and
   respiratory tract possibly due to a transient defect in the
   production of secretory IgA.  As a consequence of this hypothesis,
   one would expect cystic fibrosis patients to produce a pronounced
   antibody response against the intestinal bacterial flora.  The
   present work was therefore carried out to investigate the antibody
   response in CF patients and in normal persons against Escherichia
   coli and Bacteroides fragilis which are present in the gut in large
   numbers and against the respiratory pathogen P. aeruginosa.  A
   significantly higher prevalence of precipitins against each of the 3
   bacterial species was found in CF patients compared to normal
   persons, and the prevalence of precipitins against each of these
   bacteria increased significantly with age.  As regards P. aeruginosa
   precipitins, the prevalence and number was significantly higher in CF
   patients who have subsequently succumbed compared to CF patients who
   are still alive.  Such a correlation between the antibody response
   and the prognosis of the patients was not found as regards E. coli or
   B. fragilis.  Considering the hypothesis of Wallwork and co-workers
   concerning increased absorption of antigens from the gut, it seems
   more attractive to suppose that increased absorption of antigens from
   the gut flora occurs predominantly in CF patients with P. aeruginosa
   lung infection with a pronounced antibody response against P.
   aeruginosa.

EX In an 8-year period, a programme of screening for cystic fibrosis has
   been conducted over an extensive part of Wales.  The screening method
   used is based on the detection of a high level of albumen (greater
   than 20 mg%) in the meconium.  During the course of the
   investigations several different tests have been used.  Because of
   the high incidence of false-negative results (34%) the detection of
   protein in meconium is not an ideal screening test, but is the most
   satisfactory presently available, in the newborn period.  Because of
   its relative simplicity, low cost, absence of direct involvement of
   the parent or patient, and a high yield of positive cases, its use on
   a wider scale may be justified.

EX Several reports have indicated the presence of abnormally high
   amounts of sulphate in the mucous glands of patients with cystic
   fibrosis.  Bearing these facts in mind, we suspected that abnormal,
   over-sulphated, and strongly anionic, glycoproteins might be involved
   in the pathogenesis of CF.  The present study was carried out to
   determine whether sulphated blood-group substances occur in normal
   pancreatic tissue.  The distribution of sulphate over the exocrine
   part of pancreas does coincide with the distribution of blood-group
   substance previously observed by fluorescent microscopy.  We
   therefore find it very likely that the sulphate and blood-group
   substance are associated with the same glycoprotein molecule.  Since
   blood-group substance has been demonstrated in many secretions in
   man, and since high amounts of sulphate have been found in the
   mucous glands in CF, such a mechanism is possible in many locations
   and may thus offer an explanation for the multiorgan involvement in
   CF.

EX Usually cardiac affection in cystic fibrosis is secondary to
   progressive affection of the lungs (cor pulmonale).  In rare cases,
   babies and young children show a primary and severe cardiac affection
   caused by myocardial fibrosis.  We could recently observe two of
   these cases in our clinic.  The cases are presented and discussed.
   In babies and young children cardiac insufficiency  caused by
   cardiomyopathy might be the first presenting symptom in CF.
   Therefore, in all children with cardiomyopathy of unknown origin, CF
   has to be suspected and the sweat test has to be performed.  Rapidly
   progressive cardiac insufficiency responding poorly to treatment and
   rhythm disturbances are typical.  Correct early diagnosis is
   important for early genetic counseling.

EX Individually and collectively opinion is expressed that antibiotics
   are among the most frequently prescribed drugs in United States,
   probably also in many other countries.  While it is adopted by many
   that the increased longevity of cystic fibrosis patients is strongly
   related to antibiotic usage, this has never been documented
   adequately.  The principles which we try to follow while using
   antibiotics in CF patients are outlined.

EX The aim of our clinical study was to find if prolonged tobramycin
   therapy can prevent further rapid deterioration in cystic fibrosis
   patients.  Eleven courses of treatment were given to the nine
   patients.  Eight of these markedly improved their physical activity
   and gained weight.  However, only in four of these patients was
   clinical improvement correlated with an improved radiogram.
   Pseudomonas was eradicated from the sputum of only four patients
   during therapy but reappeared in three of them before the end of
   therapy.  Clinical improvement and negligible side effects suggest
   treatment of exacerbating Pyocyaneus bronchopneumonia with prolonged
   tobramycin therapy.  Dosage should be higher than 5 mg/kg/day with
   strict control of tobramycin blood level and awareness of side
   effects.

EX The present investigation was designed to assess the absorption and
   disposition in cystic fibrosis patients of two commonly used
   antibiotics: an aminopenicillin, epicillin, and a cephalexin,
   Ospexin.  The pharmacokinetic parameters of epicillin in patients
   with CF and their normal controls differ in a number of aspects.  The
   difference found in the maximal plasma concentrations could be
   accounted for by a manifold increase in the renal clearance of the
   drug.  Our data support the idea that patients with CF exhibit an
   unusually large and rapid renal clearance of certain penicillins.

MN ADULT.  AGE-FACTORS.  ELECTROLYTES: an.  HUMAN.  SWEAT: an.
EX Gordeuk et al. state that cystic fibrosis may be first diagnosed in
   adulthood, but we feel that a condition with such grave genetic and
   prognostic implications must be diagnosed with special caution in
   this age group.  In particular, the sweat test, which is the main
   diagnostic tool for use with children, must be interpreted in adults
   in the light of possible age-related increases in normal
   sweat-electrolyte concentration and other factors that may affect the
   assay.  Although it is generally accepted that "normal" sweat sodium
   and chloride concentrations are higher in adults than in children,
   there is no clear agreement about the upper limits of the normal
   range in adults.  The volume of sweat produced during the test may
   also have a substantial effect on electrolyte values.  For the
   diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adults, an attempt should thus be
   made to base the diagnosis not only on "elevated" sweat-electrolyte
   values and clinical impression but also on pancreatic-function data.

EX Reports of exocrine gland secretory anomalies in cystic fibrosis and
   increased calcium ion concentrations in some CF secretions and the
   importance of cellular Ca to stimulus-secretion coupling led us to
   study cellular Ca in CF.  We report data on Ca uptake studies with
   mitochondrial and microsomal fractions isolated from skin fibroblasts
   of subjects with CF and age-, sex- and passage number-matched
   controls in which mitochondria from CF cells accumulated more Ca than
   those from control cells.  We also describe subsequent studies which
   show increased mitochondrial electron transport activity, measured as
   oxygen uptake by whole cells, in cells from subjects with CF and
   obligate heterozygotes.  One can hypothesise a mechanism to link the
   altered mitochondrial Ca in CF fibroblasts and the major signs
   associated with the disease.  Data suggest that the electron
   transport system in CF and obligate heterozygote fibroblasts is more
   active than that in respective controls, in the conditions of this
   study.  The apparent central role of Ca in several pathogenetic
   pathways in CF and the data reported here in which both mitochondrial
   Ca capacity and oxygen consumption are increased in CF suggest that
   this organelle is a suitable focus for CF investigations.

EX Making the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis requires clinical suspicion
   and sweat tests.  Physicians today are aware of the main clinical
   features of pulmonary and pancreatic involvement and are suspecting
   the diagnosis earlier than in past years.  The accuracy of the sweat
   test is the most crucial factor in confirming the diagnosis.  The
   present case illustrates this point.  The main purpose of this paper
   is to serve as a reminder that the sweat test is often less than
   accurate as frequently performed.  The principal pitfall of sweat
   testing at present seems to be the use of a chloride electrode
   applied to the skin without assurance that an adequate amount of
   sweat is present.

AB Prone immersion physical exercise therapy has been used successfully
   in the physical rehabilitation of middle-aged adults with moderate to
   severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purpose of this
   pilot project was to evaluate the effects of PIPE therapy in children
   with cystic fibrosis. Three children with CF, two boys aged 6 and 14
   years and one girl aged 15 years, voluntarily participated in the
   experimental training program. The patients performed individualized
   group exercise three times a week on alternate days for 28
   consecutive weeks at an intensity of approximately 75 percent aerobic
   capacity. Duration of exercise gradually increased from 15 (3 x 5
   minutes) to 60 (3 x 20 minutes) minutes while the rest period after
   each exercise was constant at two minutes. PIPE training resulted in
   increased physical work capacity and maximal oxygen consumption in
   all three subjects. Curiously, these changes were not accompanied by
   training bradycardia.

   anemia, hypoproteinemia, edema and failure to thrive.  A blood
   transfusion resulted in some improvement, but the symptoms recurred
   in a few weeks.  Only after the correct diagnosis was made and
   appropriate therapy instituted did the patient show signs of
   improvement.  The account of this case illustrates the importance of
   considering the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in any child with

AB Serial dilutions of pyridine in water are employed for measuring the
   olfactory detection thresholds of patients. Experimental precautions
   are described that improve the precision and accuracy of the method.
   Existing data on the sensitivities of hyposmic patients are
   confirmed, but the sensitivities of normal subjects and of hyperosmic
   patients are believed to have been substantially overestimated in
   some earlier publications. Routine clinical applications of the
   revised pyridine odor threshold test are discussed. In the author's
   experience, the average cystic fibrosis patient is slightly hyposmic,
   and some cases of pituitary tumor are accompanied by a 100,000-fold
   hyperosmia.

AB An annotated catalog of clinical and pathologic observations in an
   adult population with CF has been presented. The spectrum of disease
   is broad, and the diagnosis usually requires the demonstration of
   abnormalities in multiple systems. Tissues of each germ layer have
   been found involved in CF. Correlation of clinical and pathologic
   observations suggests that manifestations are essentially episodic
   and focal. In this population, the most characteristic abnormalities
   recognized by the pathologist are focal biliary cirrhosis,
   distinctive obstructive lesions of the male genital tract, prolonged
   staphylococcal or pseudomonas colonization of respiratory secretions,
   and obstructive bronchopulmonary disease. Some form of pancreatic
   atrophy is usually present.

EX The purpose of this article is to review briefly both the techniques
   and applications of electron-probe x-ray analysis, but only studies
   of interest to pathologists will be dealt with.  The principles of
   x-ray fluorescence spectrometry, the capabilities and limitations of
   energy dispersive x-ray analysis, equipment, specimen preparation,
   and the method of electron-probe x-ray analysis are discussed.
   Applications of electron-probe x-ray analysis include mineral
   deposits in lungs, intranuclear bismuth inclusions, gold deposits in
   tissues, the nature of haemosiderin, copper in Wilson's disease,
   calcium in mitochondria, surgical implants, foreign bodies in eyes
   and wounds, the specificity of v. Kossa method for calcium,
   cytochemical localization of acid phosphatase, chromaffin and
   argentaffin reactions, the transfer of antigenic material from
   macrophages to lymphocytes, and the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis by
   electron-probe x-ray analysis of nails.

AB Several genetic diseases are described which affect the lung,
   usually or at least in some cases, in the pediatric age group.
   The four disorders discussed have been selected wither for their
   high frequency or for their demonstration of the variety of ways in
   which genetic factors can influence disease: cystic fibrosis, one of
   the most common of the metabolic disorders inherited as an autosomal
   recessive trait; immotile cilia syndrome, including Kartagener's
   syndrome, single gene disorders involving structural abnormalities
   of the cilia; asthma, a common disorder in children with a genetic
   component; and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, an inherited protein
   deficiency commonly causing obstructive lung disease in adults and
   occasionally affecting children.

EX It would seem that early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and the
   institution of an aggressive treatment program before widespread
   irreversible lung damage has occurred may greatly prolong survival.
   Individual prediction at the time of diagnosis is impossible, but
   there are a number of factors which, when considered together, enable
   the clinician to place patients in a number of broadly defined risk
   groups.  It is the definition and characteristics of these groups
   which would help the physician in assessment, counseling, and
   follow-up of patients with cystic fibrosis which are addressed in
   this article.  The heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis, sex differences,
   presentation and age at diagnosis, pulmonary function, radiologic
   assessment, and projections for the future are discussed.

AB Some of the serum proteins which bind to heparin and contribute to
   the pH 5.57 "heparin binding capacity" of human serum are
   glycoproteins; those from cystic fibrosis serum were found to be 27%
   higher in fucose (methylpentose) content, 27% lower in sialic acid
   content, and 31% lower in hexose content when compared to heparin-
   precipitated serum glycoproteins from normal control subjects.
   Hexosamine content of the heparin-precipitated serum glycoproteins
   was the same. Results of this preliminary investigation indicate that
   altered carbohydrate composition in serum glycoproteins may affect
   significantly their heparin binding capacity.

AB Lung lavage samples from rats treated in a chronic fashion with
   reserpine had mean increases of 133, 170, and 120% in the total
   protein, lipid, and carbohydrate contents, respectively, when
   compared with those of untreated control animals, when these values
   were expressed in terms of body weight.  An acute single ip
   injection of the beta-adrenergic agent isoproterenol (10 mg)
   increased the glycoprotein content of pulmonary lavage fluid from
   control rats approximately 15-19%, but only 9-10% in those from
   reserpine treated rats.  By contrast, pilocarpine (10 mg),
   administered in the same manner, caused a 15% increase in the total
   protein, carbohydrate, and lipid content of lavage samples from
   control rats and increased these same constituents in the lavage
   samples of reserpine treated rats 98, 102, and 80%, respectively.
   The increased  total carbohydrate content in the lavage samples of
   the treated animals was not associated with changes in the percent
   distribution of neutral sugars, amino sugars, or sialic acid.  The
   ratio of these various sugar components did not change in the lavage
   samples of control or reserpine treated rats upon stimulation with
   either pilocarpine or isoproterenol.  The increased total lipid
   content fround in the lavage samples from the treated rats probably
   results from an increase in phospholipids.  A decrease in
   phospholipid content occurred in the lavage samples of reserpine
   treated rats upon stimulation, while the opposite was observed in
   those of control animals.  Chronic treatment of rats with reserpine,
   thus, appears to induce an enhanced production of glycoproteins in
   the airways and to interfere with phospholipid metabolism in the
   lung.  In addition, the drug treatment enhances the secretory
   response to pilocarpine in comparison with the responses of control
   animals.  The enhanced response or hypersecretion of glycoproteins
   is a quantitative one and does not seem to involve alterations in
   the ratios or distribution of the various sugar components.  This
   disturbance in the secretory function of the respiratory tract, a
   target organ which is prominently involved in cystic fibrosis (CF)
   together with alterations in other exocrine glands which resemble
   those of CF patients, makes the reserpine treated rat a useful model
   for further study of possible pathogenetic mechanisms in CF.  The
   experimental animal model for CF developed by the chronic
   administration of reserpine to rats has been found to have changes
   in the protein content of lung lavage samples, in addition to
   morphologic and secretory alterations in the salivary glands and the
   pancreas.  Further analysis of the organic composition of lung
   lavage samples shows that the protein, carbohydrate, and lipid
   contents are significantly increased after chronic reserpine
   administration and that the response to stimulation with pilocarpine
   is enhanced in the treated animals when compared to that of
   untreated control rats.  It therefore appears that chronic reserpine
   administration causes a hypersecretion of glycoproteins and changes
   in lipid metabolism in the respiratory tract of the rat and that, in
   conjunction with previous findings in other exocrine glands, these
   effects on lung function make the reserpine treated rat a useful
   tool for the study of the pathologic disturbance seen in the major
   exocrine glands affected in CF.

AB Children with cystic fibrosis excreted elevated urinary levels of all
   three polyamines--putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Heterozygote
   parents excreted intermediate concentrations of the polyamines, but
   not levels significantly different from levels in normal controls.
   Patients with cystic fibrosis who were administered a tracer amount
   of [14C]spermidine excreted 11--13% of the radiolabel within 72 hr
   whereas normal controls excreted 60--76% of the radiolabel within 72
   hr. Spermine excretion was positively correlated with increased
   pathology as assessed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
   clinical score, whereas urinary putrescine and spermidine levels were
   negatively correlated with increased pathology.

AB The retrograde perfusion assay in the rat parotid gland was used to
   investigate the effects of salivary secretions from control and
   reserpine-treated rats on Na+ reabsorption. Results demonstrated that
   submaxillary saliva from the treated animals caused a 69% inhibition
   of Na+ reabsorption, accompanied by a 28% reduction in the volume of
   saliva secreted, and a 22% reduction in flow rate. By contrast,
   submaxillary saliva from control rats caused a 6% inhibition of Na+
   reabsorption, a 6% reduction in volume, and a 5% reduction in flow
   rate. Parotid saliva from reserpine-treated rats also inhibited Na+
   reabsorption to the extent of 39% and caused a 38% reduction in
   volume and a 33% reduction in flow. Parotid saliva from control rats
   only inhibited Na+ reabsorption to the extent of 2.7% and caused a 4--
   6% reduction in salivary volumes and flow rates. The inhibition of
   Na+ reabsorption and the reduction in salivary volume and flow rates
   caused by submaxillary saliva of reserpine-treated rats were either
   abolished or significantly reduced when the saliva was previously
   heated to 100 degrees C, frozen, and then thawed or kept in glass
   tubes at 4 degrees C for 24 hr. These results indicate that saliva
   from reserpine-treated rats have comparable effects in this assay
   system to those of saliva from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and
   further support its use as an animal model for this disease.

TI Evidence against a specific effect of serum from patients with
   cystic fibrosis on sodium-dependent glucose transport in the rat
   jejunum.

   RATS.
AB Sera from patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas (CF) and
   normal human sera were assayed for the ability to inhibit sodium-
   dependent glucose transport in rat brush-border membrane vesicles.
   Fresh CF and age- and sex-matched control sera were both inhibitory
   when compared to physiologic saline. The inhibition by CF serum was
   44 +/- 13% (mean +/- SD) at a final serum concentration of 6.7%, 67
   +/- 34% at 10% serum, and 68 +/- 28% at 20% serum. The ratio of the
   inhibition of CF sera compared to that of control sera was 1.00,
   0.78, and 0.93 at 6.7, 10, and 20% serum concentrations,
   respectively. Although a slightly greater inhibition by CF serum was
   observed at a concentration of 10%, this is probably not significant
   because no difference could be detected at a concentration of 20%
   serum. Glucose transport in the presence of serum was sensitive to
   phlorizin indicating that the residual glucose transport was
   proceeding by the sodium-dependent glucose transport system. These
   findings suggest that CF serum does not specifically inhibit the
   sodium-dependent glucose transport system. The intravesicular space
   accessible to glucose was reduced in the presence of CF or control
   serum. Fresh CF serum was 1.4 times more effective than fresh control
   serum (P less than 0.01). The presence of substantial vesicle-
   shrinking activity in control serum indicates that this activity
   cannot be considered specific for CF.

AB The importance of intracellular calcium (Ca) in secretion and
   transmembrane ion movement led us to study Ca in cells from patients
   with cystic fibrosis (CF) which is a lethal genetic exocrinopathy.
   Skin fibroblasts from patients with CF, obligate heterozygotes (HZ),
   and age- and sex-matched controls (C) were used in matched pair
   experiments measuring 45Ca exchange into and efflux from the cells
   over time. CF cell lines and HZ cell lines exhibit increased 45Ca
   exchange when compared with their respective controls (P less than
   0.005). The magnitude of this difference (approximately 30%) is not
   reduced when cells are washed with lanthanum chloride after the
   exchange period. This difference is likely attributable to an altered
   capacity of one or more of the intracellular Ca sequestering
   organelles. Further evidence for this explanation was seen in 45Ca
   efflux experiments in which CF cells retained a higher percent of
   their initial 0-time 45Ca than did C cells late in the efflux period
   (P less than 0.05). The finding of an altered Ca pool size in both CF
   and particularly HZ cells suggests that altered Ca metabolism is
   related to the basic gene defect in CF.

AB Immunochemical and functional properties of control and Cystic
   Fibrosis (CF) alpha 2-Macroglobulin (alpha 2M) are compared. Crossed
   immunoelectrophoresis and Ouchterlony double diffusion revealed no
   qualitative differences between the two alpha 2-M preparations.
   Trypsin-esterase activity assayed with BAPNA as a substrate, in the
   presence of an excess STI, gave similar ratios between total and
   active alpha 2M. These alpha 2M-trypsin complexes were equally stable
   under various experimental conditions and maintained a constant STI
   non-inhibited esterase activity. Normal and CF-alpha 2M-trypsin
   complexes were taken up by normal human fibroblasts to a similar
   extent during a four hour period. The only significant difference was
   observed when the uptake of alpha 2M from untreated sera was
   examined. The uptake of alpha 2M from CF sera was always lower than
   from pooled control sera despite large variation. Mixing of control
   and CF serum did not affect the normal uptake and other serum
   components were taken up to the normal extent. Intracellular
   degradation of CF alpha 2M had a half life of 2.0 to 2.8 hours, which
   compares well to the normal half life of 2.2 hours. More work needs
   to be done on the nature of the interaction between alpha 2M and
   proteases before a reasonable explanation for the molecular nature of
   the abnormal behavior can be sought.

AB This report presents experimental observations indicating the
   presence of an inhibitory activity in cystic fibrosis (CF) serum
   which impairs phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by rabbit as
   well as human alveolar macrophages. Of the 49 patient serum samples
   studied, 40 consistently showed greater than or equal to 60%
   inhibition, 3 showed no inhibition and 6 were in the range of 20-60%
   inhibition of Pseudomonas phagocytosis. In parallel studies, the
   phagocytosis of S. aureus and S. marcescens was found not to be
   inhibited by CF serum. Mixing of CF serum with normal serum could not
   overcome the inhibitory effect, indicating the presence of an
   inhibitory factor rather than the lack of a necessary component. The
   inhibitory activity is not lost upon exposure of serum to glass, upon
   freezing the serum once, or upon heating at 56 degrees C for 30
   minutes.

AB Serum ciliotoxic activity (SCA), which had been described in cystic
   fibrosis (CF), was studied in mutant mice with some hereditary
   alterations resembling this inherited disease. A test was developed
   to detect SCA in biologic fluids by means of a natural vibratile
   system; it consisted in the incubation of mouse sperm with different
   CF serum dilutions under controlled conditions, in order to determine
   the sperm translation cessation time (STCT) and the sperm activity
   cessation time (SACT). As the findings of this study were similar to
   those obtained by other authors who have been employing alternative
   systems, it was decided to apply this method on mice serum. Sera were
   obtained from male and female 3- to 4-wk-old mice of DBA/2J-cri,
   C57BL/6J-bgJ, and BALB/c inbred strains; SCA was investigated in
   affected homozygotes and their +/? siblings were used as controls.
   Male 8- to 16-wk-old BALB/c mice were employed as sperm donors.
   Significant differences were found between cri/cri and +/? mice of
   the DBA/2J-cri strain in both STCT and SACT determinations at 1/10
   serum dilution. It is concluded that mouse sperm is a system
   sensitive enough to detect SCA in biologic fluids from human beings.
   Likewise, the test of the mouse sperm allowed us to detect SCA in
   cri/cri mice, turning this mutation into a possible animal model for
   CF.

AB Samples of plasma or serum from 53 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, 90
   relatives of CF patients , and 159 controls have been incubated with
   porcine or bovine 125I-trypsin, electrophoresed on polyacrylamide
   gel, and autoradiographed. In these individuals, the main binding
   protein for 125I-trypsin has been shown to be alpha 2-macroglobulin
   (alpha 2M). Using this method of analysis, no difference in
   electrophoretic migration of 125I-trypsin-alpha 2M complexes has been
   observed between CF and control individuals. However, trypsin binding
   to IgG has been observed in 80% of CF patients, 30% of their mothers,
   3% of controls, and in two patients affected with pancreatitis. These
   trypsin binding immunoglobulins are called TbIg, and specifically,
   Tb1gG when referring to the G class. Experimental evidence indicates
   that binding of trypsin to IgG occurs through the Fab portion of the
   molecule. Tb1gG must be antibodies most probably induced by the
   exogenous trypsin ingested daily by most CF patients (and by patients
   affected with chronic pancreatitis). Antibodies against porcine
   pancreatic elastase have been observed using the same analysis, but
   not as frequently as Tb1g.

EX We found that cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with pancreatic
   insufficiency (PI) had a statistically lower total serum amylase
   level than normal subjects, but all values were still within the
   normal range.  Although we found that the absolute amount of salivary
   amylase, in the serum of patients with CF and PI, was the same as
   that for normal subjects, the percent of contribution was
   considerably higher.  We found that the pancreas contributed
   approximately 23% of the total serum amylase in CF patients with PI,
   a value very similar to the 34% amount found by Kamaryt et al.  We
   also found, as did Davidson et al., that CF patients without PI had
   higher total serum amylase values than did normal subjects.  Thus,
   we feel that Davidson et al. have misinterpreted the results of our
   previous study and, in fact, we feel that Davidson et al. have
   essentially confirmed our previous work by suggesting that CF
   patients with pancreatic insufficiency have an increased salivary
   amylase for reasons yet unknown.  Our experience has shown that,
   indeed, the pancreatic portion is first increased and then decreases
   as the patient with CF and apparent normal pancreatic function
   progresses, with time, toward pancreatic insufficiency.  However, the
   changes in serum amylase values in patients with CF are on the
   average due to changes in the pancreatic contribution to the serum
   and as expressed as a mean was highly significantly different for
   both normal and abnormal pancreatic function.  The second important
   point of our paper was that this mean variation occurred in serum
   samples from patients with CF that had total amylase values within
   the normal test range.  The serum salivary isoamylase in both normals
   and patients with CF and PI had a higher serum salivary percent.

AB A tracheal ring explant system, when used with 25% cystic fibrosis
   (CF) serum, displayed obvious ciliostasis. Hamster, rabbit, and
   guinea pig explants all had measurable decreases in ciliary activity
   after 24 hr of incubation in the serum. The differential response to
   CF serum (relative to normal serum) was greatly increased by using
   explants which were maintained 24-72 hr in minimal essential medium
   (MEM) with 10% horse serum and which were selected on the basis of
   optimal ciliary activity and vigor. With such a bioassay system of
   guinea pig tracheal explants, incubation with 25% normal serum would
   produce essentially no change in relative ciliary activity (score of
   242 of a possible 300), whereas CF serum resulted in an 86% decrease
   (score of 33). Scanning electron microscopic observation indicated
   that the explants displaying the CF-ciliostatic effect had
   significant accumulations of mucous over the ciliated epithelial
   surface. A biochemical viability assay (dehydrogenase activity)
   showed no cytonecrosis when CF serum-treated tissues were compared to
   standard explants (10% horse serum in MEM) or control explants (25%
   normal human serum).

AB The effect of 7 cystic fibrosis sera and 4 normal sera was
   investigated in 37 cultures of ciliated epithelium of the rabbit
   trachea. Serum was introduced in the Rose culture chambers in a
   concentration of 10% by volume. The frequency of ciliary beat was
   monitored by laser light-scattering spectroscopy. The results show
   that the response of cilia to sera can be well characterized by laser
   light scattering. Our preliminary evidence suggests that an early
   increase in the frequency of ciliary beat, followed by rapid arrest
   of ciliary activity, is a sensitive and characteristic response
   produced by cystic fibrosis serum, and not by normal serum.

AB Sera from 100 subjects were tested for the presence of the cystic
   fibrosis (CF) "factor" utilizing the short circuit current rat
   jejunum bioassay. Comparing the mean percent decrease in short
   circuit current, the presumed normal group differs from the
   homozygous CF group at P = 0.001 and from the heterozygous group at P
   = 0.05. The two CF genotypes are statistically different at P =
   0.004. There is, however, a large overlap among the three groups,
   which limits the assay's utility as a guide for factor purification
   as well as clinical use.

EX Several cystic fibrosis research groups have independently attempted
   to reproduce the isoelectric focusing work of Wilson et al.  The
   protocol that we employed with the LKB Mulitphor electrofocusing
   apparatus was that of Wilson et al., although fixing and staining of
   the polyacrylamide gels was performed in a boiling water bath for 30
   min.  In 10 of 11 sera from patients with CF, the cystic fibrosis
   protein band was directly identified by each of two independent
   observers and in the sera from nine obligate heterozygote
   individuals, the CFP band was noted in seven and eight instances by
   each observer, respectively.  In sera from 26 normal control
   individuals, the CFP band was observed in two instances.  Our results
   would support the view that the CFP band is indeed directly
   identifiable in both CT heterozygote and homozygote sera without
   recourse to photographic image enhancement and that its frequency of
   occurrence is similar to that reported previously.

EX The fact that alpha2-macroglobulin and cystic fibrosis CDA are made
   by fibroblasts and monocytes points to the fact that these markers
   and the CF protein will be of value for the detection of the CF gene
   antenatally.  Screening for CFP and CF-CDA by isoelectric focusing or
   radioimmunoassay in conjunction with quantitation of the functional
   capacity of A2M could distinguish a fetus homozygous from one
   heterozygous for the CF gene.

AB The relationship between the activity of the cystic fibrosis serum
   ciliary dyskinesia factor, detected by the rabbit tracheal bioassay,
   and clinical status of the patient has been investigated in children,
   1-24 years old, with cystic fibrosis. No significant correlation was
   found between the amount of serum factor activity and age, clinical
   status assessed by the Schwachman score, pulmonary function (vital
   capacity, functional residual capacity, total lung capacity, residual
   volume, maximum breathing capacity, maximal midinspiratory flow, and
   maximal midexpiratory flow) or blood gas levels (pCO2, pO2). The
   activity showed no significant relationship to serum
   galactosyltransferase activity in children with cystic fibrosis.

AB Ten children with CF in matched pairs were infused with either
   Intralipid or with 10% glucose on a double blind basis every other
   week for one year. Although statistically there was significantly
   greater gain in height and weight in the study year compared to the
   previous year only for the test group, both groups improved more than
   expected. Cumulative data analysis showed greater improvement for the
   Intralipid group (23 of a possible 45 points) compared to the glucose
   group (-2 points; P less than .02). This study indicates the need to
   better define the role of nutrition in the pathophysiology of CF.
   Meanwhile, it is recommended that all children with CF have plasma
   linoleic acid levels measured at least once yearly, and if levels are
   low, appropriate supplements should be given.

AB A roentgenogram scoring system is presented that is useful in the
   evaluation and follow-up of patients with cystic fibrosis. The system
   has been shown to be reproducible by and between observers and to
   correlate significantly with results of pulmonary function tests,
   Shwachman-Kulczycki scores, and, in a short-term evaluation,
   morbidity.

AB Essential fatty acid supplementation with oral safflower oil (1
   gm/kg/day) to 11 cystic fibrosis patients (aged 6 months to 14 years)
   for one year produced no significant change in sweat chloride
   concentration (mEq/liter) or sweat rate (gm/min/m2), Addition of
   vitamin E (10 mg/kg/day) to the safflower oil had no effect on sweat
   chloride concentration or rate compared to placebo. No clinical
   improvement could be detected compared to a control group. These
   results do not support previous reports of the effects of fatty acid
   supplementation on sweat electrolyte concentrations in cystic
   fibrosis.

   HYPONATREMIA: et.  INFANT.  MALE.
AB The records of all children in the Tucson area diagnosed as having
   cystic fibrosis (CF) before the age of 12 months were reviewed to
   ascertain the prevalence of metabolic alkalosis as a major presenting
   manifestation of CF. Five of eleven infants (46%) in whom CF had been
   diagnosed between 1 and 12 months of age initially were seen with
   hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and metabolic alkalosis unassociated with
   marked dehydration, hyperpyrexia, or major pulmonary and/or
   gastrointestinal symptoms. Two infants had repeated episodes of
   metabolic alkalosis; for one of these infants, both episodes of
   metabolic alkalosis occurred before the diagnosis of CF. It is
   postulated that chronic loss of sweat electrolytes together with mild
   gastrointestinal or respiratory illness may predispose the infant
   with cystic fibrosis to a severe electrolyte and acid-base
   disturbance. The lack of shock and hyperpyrexia together with the
   apparent chronicity of electrolyte losses differentiates metabolic
   alkalosis from the heat prostration syndrome, a more acute
   complication of cystic fibrosis. Quantitative sweat testing should be
   part of the evaluation of any infant with unexplained metabolic
   alkalosis. Serum electrolytes should be assessed regularly in infants
   with cystic fibrosis during hot weather months.

AB From a review of 2,000 autopsies of children, 16 cases of extensive
   necrosis and scarring fibrosis of the myocardium were found. These
   lesions involved mainly the left ventricle and spared the
   endocardium, the pericardium, and the coronary vessels. These
   necrotic of fibrotic heart lesions were found to be closely
   associated with various pancreatic diseases: cystic fibrosis (11
   cases), pancreatic lipomatosis (2 cases), extensive small bowel
   resection (3 cases, 2 of which were associated with acute
   interstitial pancreatitis). To explain these unexpected associations,
   two hypotheses can be put forth: (1) The lack of absorption of some
   presently undetermined substances indispensable for the correct
   trophicity of the myocardium, and (2) the release in the blood of
   proteolytic enzymes with consecutive activation of phlogistic
   substances such as kinins.

EX I propose that clinicians should have a general understanding of what
   little physiology is known about tocopherol, be able to recognize the
   circumstances that cause low tocopherol levels, understand when to
   provide physiologic replacement therapy, and accept the
   responsibility for protecting their patients from uncontrolled
   experimental use of tocopherols.  Tocopherol physiology, tocopherol
   pharmacology, tocopherol deficiency, therapy in deficiency states,
   and pharmacological doses of tocopherol are discussed.  Patients with
   prolonged fat malabsorption and some premature infants receiving iron
   must be given vitamin E.  Use of tocopherol therapy in
   bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retrolental fibroplasia, while
   promising, is unproven and should be used only in a controlled study.
   Research on the role of vitamin E in human physiology is entering a
   rapid-growth phase.

EX I have diagnosed six cystic fibrosis infants under 1 year of age,
   four of whom had documented episodes of hypoelectrolytemia and severe
   metabolic alkalosis.  These additional data support our previous
   hypothesis that chronic sweat electrolyte depletion, more frequently
   than previously recognized, can cause severe metabolic derangements
   in infants with cystic fibrosis, especially those living in both
   humid and dry, hot climates.

TI An evaluation of the forced expiration technique as an adjunct to

MN ADOLESCENCE.  ADULT.  FEMALE.  HUMAN.  MALE.
EX A criticism often levelled at the forced expiration technique (FET)
   is that it increases and may even produce bronchospasm.  It was our
   impression that the use of forced expiration when combined with
   periods of relaxed diaphragmatic breathing did not aggravate
   bronchospasm and shortened the postural drainage session.  Two groups
   of patients were studied: 24 with cystic fibrosis to evaluate the use
   of the FET as an independent means of postural drainage; and 20
   asthmatic patients to assess the effect of the FET on bronchospasm.
   The studies indicate that the forced expiration technique increases
   the efficiency of postural drainage, but does not increase airway
   obstruction.  This technique can be applied to both medical and
   surgical conditions when postural drainage, or a modified form of
   postural drainage, is indicated.

AB A procedure is described which permits the rapid isolation of large
   amounts of elastase and cathepsin G from purulent sputum. This
   procedure involves: (1) digestion of sputum with DNase, (2)
   extraction of the insoluble residue that remains with 1 M NaCl, pH 8,
   (3) affinity chromatography on Sepharose-bound Trasylol, and (4)
   separation of the two enzymes by chromatogrphy on CM-Sephadex.
   Starting with 500 g of sputum it was possible to isolate 175 mg of
   each of these two enzymes within 7 to 10 days. Active site titration
   indicated both enzymes to be at least 97% pure. Disc gel
   electrophoresis in the presence and absence of SDS and amino acid
   sequence of the N-terminal region support the conclusion that the
   elastase and cathepsin G isolated from sputum are identical to the
   same enzymes isolated directly from the leukocytes of human blood.

AB We have shown that skin fibroblast from patients with cystic fibrosis
   (CF) and from carriers for CF [heterozygotes (HZ)] consume more O2
   than do their controls. When the mitochondrial electron transport
   inhibitor rotenone was added to the cells, the relative inhibition of
   O2 consumption was CF greater than HZ greater than controls (P less
   than 0.005 in both comparisons). Because rotenone specifically
   inhibits NADH dehydrogenase, [NADH: (acceptor) oxidoreductase, EC
   1.6.99.3], which is the enzyme of energy-conserving site 1 of the
   mitochondrial electron transport system, activity and kinetics of
   this enzyme system were studied in fibroblast homogenates. NADH
   dehydrogenase activity was equal in cells from the three genotypes.
   At pH 8.0, affinity of the enzyme for its substrate was CF greater
   than HZ = controls; at pH 8.6, affinity was CF greater than HZ =
   controls (P less than 0.005 for the differences). pH optima for the
   genotypes were without exception 8.6 (CF), 8.3 (HZ), and 8.0
   (control). HZ and control lines were distinguished unequivocally in a
   blind test on the basis of differences in pH optima. Purified
   mitochondrial preparations revealed pH optima identical to those
   found in whole cell homogenates. These data suggest that the mutant
   gene responsible for CF is expressed in the complex mitochondrial
   NADH dehydrogenase system.

EX Ten years ago, we demonstrated that chronic administration of
   isoproterenol to rats results is structural and functional changes of
   their salivary glands similar to those seen in exocrine glands of
   patients with cystic fibrosis.  Recently, we began to study the
   cellular pathophysiology of these glands and managed to achieve
   pharmacological control of this abnormality.  We demonstrated that
   administration of a beta-adrenergic antagonist in these animals
   resulted in the correction of the electrolyte abnormality which is
   very similar to that seen in the sweat glands of patients with cystic
   fibrosis.  These two examples of manipulation of the secretory
   processes in exocrine glands of experimental animals demonstrate the

EX The change of life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients has
   stimulated our interest in assessing the understanding and
   utilization of genetic information by adult CF patients and how this
   may affect their coping mechanism(s).  The present study was designed
   to obtain information in these areas with the expectation that more
   effective genetic counseling might be developed for this enlarging
   group of patients.  Knowledge of genetics, attitudes concerning
   reproduction, attitudes toward prenatal diagnosis, and attitudes
   toward a carrier identification study are reported for 25 males and
   15 females with proven cystic fibrosis.

EX Development of a new test to detect carriers of the gene for cystic
   fibrosis was announced.  The test involves the interaction between
   red blood cells from a mouse and a small amount of a person's blood
   serum.  The gene for cystic fibrosis is associated with a lectin, a
   factor in the person's blood serum that acts to agglutinate (or
   cluster) the red blood cells of the mouse.

AB In a series of 62 cases of cystic fibrosis presenting at the
   Transvaal Memorial Hospital for Children, Johannesburg, during the
   10-year period 1968-1978, 15 patients required surgical treatment
   for 17 complications of the disease.  Meconium ileus, rectal
   prolapse, intussusception and ethmoiditis were the commonest
   surgical presentations, and portal hypertension, bronchial
   obstruction and nasal polyposis were also experienced.  As the basic
   defect is unknown, treatment today is still directed towards these
   usually unpredictable secondary consequences.

AB The bacteriological effect of chemotherapy against Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa (Ps.ae.) in lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis is
   reviewed. During a 5-year period 49 children and adults were treated
   with 190 courses of different antibiotics. The mucoid strains of
   Ps.ae. disappeared in 72.0% of the courses in which a combination of
   tobramycin and carbenicillin was employed. Tobramycin given alone had
   only bacteriological effect in 26.6% of the courses. Colimycin alone
   or in combination with carbenicillin had no effect. In 18 patients
   who received subsequent courses of tobramycin and combination of
   tobramycin and carbenicillin a significant difference in favour of
   the combination therapy was found, also in cases with many
   precipitins against Ps.ae. in serum. In 74.5% of the initially
   successful courses the patients were recolonized with Ps.ae. within 1
   month. No nephrotoxic or ototoxic side effects were demonstrated in
   spite of the high doses of tobramycin (10 mg/kg/24 h) emmployed and
   the repeated courses.

AB Bronchial secretions from 207 children suffering from various
   pulmonary diseases and from 15 healthy controls were tested
   concentration of IgA, IgG, lactoferrin and lysozyme. The results
   obtained suggest that in many cases of chronic lung diseases in
   children the levels of lactoferrin and immunoglobulins, especially
   secretory IgA, are very low. In severe infections (cystic fibrosis,
   bronchiectases) significant increase of IgG concentration was
   observed.

AB Assays based on the counting of total cells and of colony-forming
   cells were used to demonstrate that neither dexamethasone nor
   dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) kills human
   fibroblasts under a variety of conditions. These results contradict
   those of previous studies showing that dexamethasone and dibutyryl
   cyclic AMP kill a higher percentage of fibroblasts from normal humans
   than from individuals with cystic fibrosis.

TI Premature senescence in cultured skin fibroblasts from subjects with

AB Cultured skin fibroblasts from subjects with cystic fibrosis
   exhibited normal population doubling times in early passages. After
   about 13 cumulative population doublings, cystic fibrosis lines
   doubled more slowly than controls and ceased doubling after about 19
   weekly passages. Control lines continued doubling for 27 passages.
   The premature senescence noted in cells from subjects with cystic
   fibrosis reconciles controversial observations of cell doubling
   reported in the literature. Data presented here demonstrate that
   experiments with cystic fibrosis cells in late passage may generate
   misleading results since differences from control lines may be
   ascribed to generalized senile changes rather than to specific
   results of the cystic fibrosis genotype.

AB With the early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and the better management
   of these patients in childhood increasing numbers are surviving to
   adult life. The main problem requiring continuous medical care in the
   older cystic fibrosis patient is persisting and often progressive
   chest disease. For this reason the cystic fibrosis clinic for
   adolescents and young adults was started in the Western Infirmary in
   1975. This paper presents our observations on 13 patients who had
   attended between 1975 and 1977. Eleven patients are alive and well
   and have shown no evidence of deterioration over this period. Ten are
   at school or in regular employment. With optimum medical supervision
   it is possible to give young adults with cystic fibrosis a worthwhile
   existence.

   REVIEW.
AB "Psychosocial" literature on cystic fibrosis (CF) is critically
   reviewed.  Major methodological shortcomings include the anecdotal
   nature of findings, overemphasis on negative consequences of the
   disease, and the lack of a suitable theoretical framework.  Avenues
   for future research are suggested.

EX This review is intended to present a brief summary of the important
   areas and concepts of cystic fibrosis relevant to clinical practice,
   indicating those that remain controversial and offering opinions
   based on both relevant literature and the clinical experience of the
   Cleveland Cystic Fibrosis Center.  The sweat test, tests of
   pancreatic function, tests of pulmonary function, genetics and family
   history in diagnosis, infertility as a diagnostic factor, the role of
   circulating factors in diagnosis, heterozygote detection and prenatal
   diagnosis, miscellaneous factors leading to diagnosis, neonatal
   screening, and general observations on the diagnosis of CF are
   examined.  A philosophy of treatment, physical measures,
   antimicrobial therapy, aerosol therapy, the role of hospitalization
   in a therapeutic program, other drug therapy, the treatment of cor
   pulmonale, respiratory failure, and specific pulmonary complications
   are discussed.  Enzyme replacement and obstructive phenomena, glucose
   intolerance, the treatment of the sweat defect, psychosocial therapy,
   and prognosis are also considered.

MN ADOLESCENCE.  CHILD.  FEMALE.  HUMAN.  HYPERTENSION-PORTAL: co.
   MALE.  METHODS.
AB Apart from the sound physiologic basis for the distal splenorenal
   shunt as compared with the portacaval shunt and the conventional
   central splenorenal shunt, there are two important reasons why we
   think the use of this type of shunt is especially advantageous in
   children with portal hypertension secondary to cystic fibrosis.
   Firstly, the thick, fibrotic retroperitoneal area in the porta
   hepatis, where a portacaval shunt has to be constructed, can be
   avoided, which makes the distal splenorenal shunt the easier
   operation. Secondly, notwithstanding the relatively small-sized
   vessels, a wide anastomosis can be constructed with a high flow rate
   and, therefore, a minimal chance of shunt thrombosis.

EX Recently, we found the cystic fibrosis mucociliary inhibitor in urine
   from homozygotes and heterozygotes, but not from normals.  In recent
   studies we have attempted to compare the relative concentrations of
   CFMI in material from homozygotes and heterozygotes.  The unites of
   inhibition which reflect the concentration of the CFMI in serum and
   tissue culture medium fractions from heterozygotes is close to
   one-half of that in fractions from homozygous sources.  With
   purification of the CFMI and the generation of a monospecific
   antibody preparation, answers will become available to the questions
   of whether or not there is a normal counterpart to the CFMI and
   whether or not quantitation of the CFMI will be useful in
   heterozygote detection and prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

   RESPIRATORY-FUNCTION-TESTS.
AB Tests claimed to detect small airway disease were evaluated in
   children.  Fifty-two subjects who were normal, 30 with cystic
   fibrosis (CF), and 35 with asthma were selected on the basis of
   normal spirometry, informed consent being obtained from them and
   their parents.  Tests undertaken were measurement of maximum
   expiratory flow volume curves breathing air and a helium-oxygen
   mixture, single breath nitrogen washout curves, lung volumes, and,
   except in the normal subjects, measurement of arterial oxygen
   tension.  Closing volumes were normal in most children with CF and
   asthma, whereas the slope of the alveolar plateau was abnormal in
   83%.  Maximum expiratory flow rate at 50% of total lung capacity was
   reduced in 65% and maximum mid-expiratory flow rate in 57%; residual
   volume increased in 51%, and results of other tests were abnormal in
   less than 50% of the children.  There was evidence suggesting that
   lung disease was more patchy in children with mild CF than in those
   with interval phase asthma.  These tests do not detect specific
   pathological processes in small airways but reflect the consequences
   of small airway abnormalities, which may vary in the same disease as
   well as in different diseases.  No one test alone appears most
   useful.  Together they contribute to understanding the functional
   abnormalities present in each individual.

EX We theorize that cystic fibrosis may be a disease in which a plasma
   factor with lectin-like activity stimulates mucus secretion, causes
   precipitation of mucus glycoproteins, and incidentally affects
   lymphocytes in culture.  To confirm our theory, we planned to search
   for additional lectin-like activities in CF serum.  Our experiments
   suggest that the lectin-like substance in CF blood requires IgM for
   its red-blood-cell-agglutination activity.  Thus, no difference in
   agglutination titer is observed between CF homozygotes and
   heterozygotes, because IgM is the limiting factor, and IgM
   concentrations do not differ appreciably in such subjects.  We
   suspect that CF homozygotes have a larger pool of free lectin in
   their blood than do heterozygotes, so that quantitation of this free
   lectin pool may distinguish between the two phenotypes.  Excess free
   lectin may account for the signs and symptoms of CF, whereas lesser
   amounts may theoretically be advantageous to the heterozygote.

AB In 25 children (13 male; 12 female) with cystic fibrosis aged 6
   months to 16 years and 24 matched controls total serum vitamin E
   levels and fatty acid patterns of serum cholesterol esters,
   phospholipids and triglycerides are demonstrated. Compared to
   controls (1.02 +/- 0.24 mg/dl) the total serum vitamin E levels are
   significantly decreased in patients with cystic fibrosis (0.30 +/-
   0.26 mg/dl) (p less than 0.01). There is no significant difference
   comparing the fatty acid patterns of the serum ester fractions of
   both groups. Differences can be seen best in the cholesterol ester
   fraction. In this fraction linoleic acid shows a trend to be
   decreased in the cystic fibrosis patients compared to the control
   group. A possible influence of height velocity on the levels of
   essential fatty acids is discussed.
